At UNAIDS global scale, the tool predicted baseline bridge period success rate of 23.96\% (95\% CI: 23.94--23.98\%), with evidence-based interventions improving success to 43.50\% (95\% CI: 43.48--43.52\%)---an 81.6\% relative improvement, representing 4.1 million additional successful transitions globally.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Promise and Challenge of LAI-PrEP}
Long-acting injectable antiretroviral agents represent a paradigm shift in HIV prevention, with demonstrated efficacy exceeding 96\% in diverse populations \cite{landovitz2021,delany2022}. In landmark trials including HPTN 083 (n=4,566 men who have sex with men and transgender women) and HPTN 084 (n=3,224 cisgender women), LAI-CAB demonstrated 66--89\% superior efficacy compared to daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) \cite{landovitz2021,delany2022,marzinke2021}. The PURPOSE clinical trial program further validated these findings in 10,761 participants in real-world settings \cite{bekker2023}.
Despite this compelling efficacy profile, the implementation of LAI-PrEP faces a critical structural challenge: the ``bridge period'' between prescription and the first injection. This implementation gap, unique to LAI-PrEP, creates a vulnerable window during which patients must navigate HIV testing, insurance authorization, and clinical appointments before receiving protective injections. Current guidelines specify HIV testing within 7 days before injection \cite{who2025,cdc2021}, creating mandatory delays that expose patients to the risk of attrition.

\subsection{The Bridge Period Attrition Crisis}

Real-world implementation data reveal the magnitude of this challenge. Studies have documented that only 52.9\% of patients prescribed LAI-PrEP successfully received their first injection---a 47.1\% attrition rate during the bridge period \cite{patel2023}. This attrition disproportionately affects populations facing structural barriers: adolescents (60--70\% attrition), people who inject drugs (70--80\% attrition), and cisgender women (50--60\% attrition) \cite{hosek2017,walters2020}. These disparities reflect longstanding inequities in the oral PrEP cascade, where only 25\% of indicated individuals currently access prevention services \cite{siegler2018}.

The bridge period thus represents what we term a ``cascade paradox'': LAI-PrEP eliminates daily adherence requirements that drive oral PrEP discontinuation, but introduces new structural barriers concentrated in a high-risk temporal window. Patients who successfully navigate the bridge period demonstrate 81--83\% long-term persistence, compared to approximately 50\% with oral PrEP. However, nearly half of patients never reach the point where the superior adherence profile of LAI-PrEP can benefit them.

The Patient Information Handout (Supplementary File S2) addresses this challenge by providing patients with clear timeline expectations, barrier-specific support resources, and practical success strategies, aiming to empower patient navigation through education and anticipatory guidance.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\textbf{Critical insights: Where barriers occur in the PrEP cascade.} Oral PrEP faces post-initiation adherence challenges, while LAI-PrEP faces pre-initiation access challenges during the bridge period. The implementation paradox shows that LAI-PrEP's superior retention (81--83\%) can only benefit patients who successfully navigate the bridge period, where 47.1\% are currently lost to structural barriers.}
\label{fig:cascade}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Need for Clinical Decision Support}

The current implementation of LAI-PrEP lacks systematic tools to identify high-risk patients, prioritize interventions, or allocate resources. Clinicians face critical questions at the point of prescription: Which patients are most likely to successfully navigate the bridge period? What barriers will they face? Which evidence-based interventions demonstrate effectiveness? How can limited navigation resources be optimally allocated?
A systematic clinical decision flowchart has been developed to address these questions at point-of-care (Supplementary File S5).
Existing HIV prevention decision support tools focus on PrEP indication assessment rather than implementation support. No validated clinical decision support system addresses the unique challenges of LAI-PrEP bridge period navigation. This gap is particularly critical as LAI-PrEP scales nationally and globally, with implementation efforts targeting populations with complex structural barriers.

\subsection{Study Objectives}

We developed and validated a clinical decision support tool specifically designed for the navigation of the LAI-PrEP bridge period. The tool synthesizes evidence from major clinical trials and implementation studies to provide: (1) population- and patient-specific risk stratification; (2) identification of structural barriers; (3) prioritized evidence-based intervention recommendations; and (4) predicted results with and without interventions.

This manuscript presents comprehensive validation findings from progressive testing on four scales (1,000 to 21.2 million patients), representing---to our knowledge---the largest validation study of any HIV prevention decision support tool. Our objectives were to: (1) validate population-specific predictions against published clinical trial outcomes; (2) quantify the individual and cumulative impact of structural barriers; (3) assess the effectiveness predictions of the intervention; and (4) establish statistical precision sufficient for clinical implementation and international policy guidelines.

It is critical to distinguish between \textbf{computational validity} and \textbf{clinical validity} in interpreting these results. This study establishes computational validity demonstrating that the algorithm produces stable, precise predictions across scales from 1,000 to 21.2 million synthetic patients, with internal consistency and alignment with published trial baseline success rates. The progressive validation methodology confirms algorithmic robustness and mathematical correctness.

However, \textbf{prospective clinical validation} is required before implementation. While the tool's architecture is sound and population baselines match published ranges, intervention effect sizes derive from heterogeneous evidence sources including cross-field extrapolation. Real-world effectiveness may differ from modeled predictions due to: (1) implementation fidelity variation across clinical settings, (2) local context factors not captured in the model, (3) intervention interactions in practice differing from theoretical combinations, and (4) population-specific effect modification not yet documented in the LAI-PrEP literature.

The validated computational framework establishes the upper bound of what systematic bridge period support could achieve under optimal implementation. Prospective pilot studies (described in Section~\ref{sec:prospective_validation}) are essential to calibrate model parameters to real-world effectiveness, assess implementation feasibility, and identify context-specific modifications required for different healthcare settings.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Tool Development and Evidence Synthesis}

\subsubsection{Conceptual Framework}

The LAI-PrEP Bridge Period Decision Support Tool operationalizes a three-strategy framework for bridge period navigation: (1) eliminate the bridge through same-day switching protocols; (2) compress the bridge via accelerated diagnostics; and (3) navigate the bridge through targeted interventions. This framework extends traditional PrEP cascade models to address the unique implementation challenges of LAI-PrEP.

\subsubsection{Evidence Sources}

We conducted systematic evidence synthesis from multiple sources:

\textbf{Clinical Trials (n$>$15,000 participants):} HPTN 083 (4,566 MSM and transgender women, 2017--2020) \cite{landovitz2021}, HPTN 084 (3,224 cisgender women, 2017--2021) \cite{delany2022}, PURPOSE-1 (5,338 cisgender women, 2021--ongoing), PURPOSE-2 (2,183 diverse participants, 2021--ongoing) \cite{bekker2023}.

\textbf{Implementation Studies:} Real-world effectiveness data documenting 52.9\% injection bridge period success rates, patient navigation effectiveness (1.5-fold improvement), and long-term persistence patterns (81--83\% once initiated) \cite{patel2023}.

\textbf{Supporting Evidence:} WHO HIV testing guidelines (July 2025 update) \cite{who2025}, CDC LAI-PrEP implementation guide \cite{cdc2021}, patient navigation effectiveness studies from cancer care (10--40\% improvement) and structural barrier literature \cite{hosek2017,walters2020}.

\subsection{Evidence Foundation for Algorithm Parameters}
\textbf{Evidence Tier Definitions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Tier 1 (Direct LAI-PrEP):} Evidence from LAI-PrEP trials (HPTN 083, HPTN 084, PURPOSE) or early implementation programs. Highest confidence for LAI-PrEP bridge period.
\item \textbf{Tier 2 (HIV Prevention Analog):} Evidence from oral PrEP cascade, HIV care engagement, or closely related HIV prevention contexts. Moderate confidence with biological/behavioral parallels.
\item \textbf{Tier 3 (Cross-Field Extrapolation):} Evidence from other healthcare delivery challenges (oncology, chronic disease management) adjusted for HIV prevention context. Lower confidence; requires prospective validation.
\end{itemize}
Complete evidence synthesis with detailed effect size derivations is provided in Supplementary File S7. The configuration file (Supplementary File S3) documents all parameters with source annotations enabling external audit and local adaptation based on emerging evidence.

All intervention effect sizes represent conservative estimates based on published literature, with ranges reflecting uncertainty across different implementation contexts. The configuration architecture enables rapid evidence updates as LAI-PrEP implementation data accumulate, without requiring code modifications.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Development}
\textbf{Population-Specific Baseline Rates:} We extracted population-specific attrition rates from published trials and implementation studies (see Supplementary File S7, Table 1 for complete source mapping). For populations without direct LAI-PrEP data (e.g., adolescents, people who inject drugs), we extrapolated from oral PrEP cascade data and expert consultation, using conservative estimates. Sources for published ranges in Table 4:
\begin{itemize}
\item MSM: HPTN 083 trial data \cite{landovitz2021}
\item General population: CAN Community Health implementation data \cite{patel2023}
\item Transgender women: HPTN 083 sub-analysis \cite{marzinke2021}
\item Cisgender women: HPTN 084 and PURPOSE-1 trials \cite{delany2022,bekker2023}
\item Pregnant/lactating: Inferred from cisgender women data with clinical consultation
\item Adolescents (16--24y): Extrapolated from adolescent oral PrEP cascade studies \cite{hosek2017}
\item PWID: Extrapolated from oral PrEP cascade and harm reduction literature \cite{walters2020}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Structural Barriers (n=21):} We identified barriers through a review of the literature and stakeholder consultation, assigning impact weights based on published effect sizes and expert consensus (see Supplementary File S7, Table 1). Barriers were modeled using multiplicative combination (specified in the configuration as \texttt{barrier\_combination\_method: multiplicative}), with a ceiling of 95\% attrition to prevent mathematical impossibilities. Under this approach, the probability of bridge period failure compounds across barriers: for example, a patient facing transportation barriers ($-$15\% baseline reduction) and insurance delays ($-$12\% baseline reduction) experiences combined attrition risk that exceeds simple addition. The multiplicative model better captures the synergistic effect of multiple barriers, where each additional barrier proportionally reduces the remaining success probability. To demonstrate robustness of this modeling choice, sensitivity analysis comparing additive versus multiplicative barrier combination produced outcome ranges within Â±1.8 percentage points (see Supplementary Figure S2), confirming that qualitative conclusions (population rankings, intervention priorities) remain unchanged.

\textbf{Evidence-Based Interventions (n=21):} We quantified the effects of the intervention based on the published literature, with each intervention assigned an effect size, evidence level (High/Moderate/Emerging), and source documentation (see Supplementary File S7, Table 2 for complete intervention library mapping). Combined intervention effects were calculated using a diminishing returns model (70\% of sum) to account for overlapping mechanisms and ceiling effects.

The 70\% diminishing returns factor reflects empirical observations that multi-component healthcare interventions typically yield 60--80\% of their theoretical additive effect due to: (1) overlapping mechanisms (e.g., both navigation and transportation help with appointment attendance); (2) patient saturation effects (limited capacity to participate in multiple simultaneous interventions); and (3) irreducible failure modes (e.g., patients who move out of state) \cite{craig2008,paskett2011}. The 10\% mechanism overlap penalty applies when interventions share tagged mechanisms, ensuring diverse approaches address multiple complementary pathways.

 \textbf{Sensitivity Analysis:} To assess robustness of modeling choices, we conducted sensitivity analyses varying three key parameters: (1) the diminishing returns factor (Î±) from 60\% to 80\% in 5\% increments; (2) the barrier combination method (additive versus multiplicative); and (3) population-specific baseline success rates (Â±25\% relative variation). Primary outcome rankings (population disparities, intervention priorities, regional equity gaps) remained stable across all sensitivity scenarios (see Supplementary Figure S1-S3). Maximum absolute deviation in predicted global success rate was Â±2.5 percentage points (range: 21.5\% to 26.5\% vs. primary estimate 23.96\%), confirming that qualitative conclusions are not highly sensitive to specific parameter values.

Real-time processing enables point-of-care clinical decision support.}
\label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Combined Intervention Effects and Diminishing Returns}

The tool frequently recommends packages of multiple interventions for patients facing complex barriers. To model combined effects realistically, we implemented a diminishing returns framework acknowledging that interventions targeting overlapping barriers or mechanisms yield less-than-additive benefits.

\textbf{Diminishing Returns Model:} When multiple interventions are selected for a single patient:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Individual effects are first calculated:} Each intervention $i$ has a base effect $e_i$ (e.g., +10\% success probability)
\item \textit{Mechanism overlap is quantified:} Interventions sharing mechanisms receive penalty (see Section 2.1.5)
\item \textit{Combined effect calculation} applies diminishing returns factor ($\alpha$ = 0.70):
\[
E_{\text{combined}} = \alpha \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i
\]
where $n$ is the number of selected interventions
\end{enumerate}

This $\alpha$ = 0.70 factor reflects that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Interventions may address overlapping barriers (e.g., both navigation and transportation help with appointment attendance)
\item Patients face saturation effects (limited capacity to participate in multiple simultaneous interventions)
\item Some failure modes are irreducible (e.g., patients who move out of state during the bridge period)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example Calculation:} Patient with transportation, insurance, and mistrust barriers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Transportation Assistance: +8\% (base effect)
\item Insurance Navigation: +10\% (base effect)
\item Medical Mistrust Intervention: +12\% (base effect)
\item Naive additive prediction: 8 + 10 + 12 = +30\%
\item Realistic combined effect: 0.70 $\times$ 30 = +21\%
\end{itemize}

The combined improvement of 21\% (vs. the naive sum of 30\%) more accurately reflects real-world implementation, where multiple interventions together typically yield 60--80\% of their theoretical additive effect \cite{paskett2011}. This conservative approach prevents overestimation of intervention benefits and aligns with published meta-analyses of multi-component interventions in healthcare \cite{craig2008}.

\textbf{Ceiling Effects:} Additionally, the model implements a maximum success probability of 95\% to prevent mathematical impossibilities. Patients starting near this ceiling receive diminished benefits from additional interventions, reflecting the reality that some attrition is unavoidable (e.g., patients moving, changing insurance, or deciding against PrEP for personal reasons).

\subsubsection{Software Architecture and Configuration Management}

The tool implements a configuration-driven architecture that separates algorithmic logic from clinical parameters, allowing rapid updating as new evidence emerges without code modifications. All baselines for the population, barriers, and interventions are externalized in JSON format, with version control and validation checksums that ensure data integrity.

\textbf{Configuration Structure:} The external configuration file contains: (1) Population-specific parameters (n=7 populations, baseline attrition rates, evidence sources); (2) Structural barriers (n=21 barriers with quantified impacts); (3) Evidence-based interventions (n=21 interventions with improvement estimates, evidence levels, cost assessments, implementation complexity ratings); (4) Recommendations for healthcare settings (n=8 settings); (5) Risk stratification thresholds; (6) Algorithm parameters with diminishing returns modeling.

\textbf{Diversity of the intervention mechanism:} To prevent redundant recommendations, interventions are tagged with mechanism categories: eliminate\_bridge (same-day switching), compress\_bridge (accelerated testing), navigate\_bridge (patient/peer navigation), remove\_barriers (transportation, childcare, mobile delivery) and system\_level (harm reduction integration, bundle payment). The algorithm applies overlap penalties (10\% reduction per shared mechanism) when selecting intervention combinations, ensuring that diverse approaches address multiple failure modes.

\textbf{Version Control and Reproducibility:} Configuration versioning enables: retrospective analysis using historical parameters, comparative effectiveness research across parameter sets, sensitivity analyses varying barrier weights or intervention effects, and adaptation for different healthcare contexts or populations. All validation runs the documented configuration version (v2.0.0), ensuring complete reproducibility.

\subsubsection{Mechanism Diversity Scoring Algorithm}

To optimize limited implementation resources and avoid redundant recommendations, the tool employs a mechanism diversity scoring algorithm when selecting intervention combinations. This approach ensures that recommended interventions address multiple complementary failure modes rather than duplicating similar strategies, maximizing implementation efficiency.

\textbf{Mechanism Classification Framework:} Each intervention in the 21-intervention library is tagged with one or more mechanism categories representing its primary mode of action:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{eliminate\_bridge:} Same-day switching protocols that completely remove the bridge period for patients already on oral PrEP (e.g., oral-to-injectable transition without mandatory re-testing delay)
    \item \textbf{compress\_bridge:} Accelerated diagnostics and rapid testing that shorten the vulnerable window (e.g., point-of-care HIV RNA testing reducing mandatory wait from 33--45 days to 10--14 days)
    \item \textbf{navigate\_bridge:} Patient navigation, peer navigation, and care coordination services that help patients traverse complex multi-step processes
    \item \textbf{remove\_barriers:} Direct barrier mitigation (e.g., transportation vouchers, childcare assistance, mobile delivery services)
    \item \textbf{structural\_support:} System-level facilitation (e.g., insurance navigation, prior authorization acceleration, pharmacy assistance programs)
    \item \textbf{clinical\_support:} Provider-level and clinical environment interventions (e.g., medical mistrust counseling, LGBTQ+-affirming care protocols, confidentiality protections)
    \item \textbf{system\_level:} Healthcare system redesign (e.g., harm reduction service integration for PWID, bundled payment models, telemedicine integration)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Diversity Scoring Algorithm:} When selecting intervention combinations for a given patient profile, the algorithm implements a five-step prioritization process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Eligibility Screening:} Identify all interventions applicable to the patient's barriers and population characteristics (e.g., adolescent-specific interventions only recommended for patients aged 16--24 years; harm reduction integration only for PWID)
    
    \item \textbf{Initial Effectiveness Ranking:} Rank eligible interventions by predicted effectiveness (expected improvement in success probability) based on evidence-derived effect sizes and patient-specific barrier profiles
    
    \item \textbf{Iterative Selection with Overlap Penalty:} Select interventions iteratively, applying a mechanism overlap penalty for shared mechanisms. For each candidate intervention sharing $k$ mechanism tags with already-selected interventions:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{adjusted\_effect} = \text{base\_effect} \times (1 - 0.10 \times k)
    \end{equation}
    This 10\% penalty per shared mechanism reflects diminishing marginal returns from redundant approaches addressing the same failure mode.
    
    \item \textbf{Marginal Benefit Threshold:} Continue adding interventions until marginal benefit falls below clinical significance threshold (2\% absolute improvement) or maximum intervention count reached (typically 5--7 interventions, representing practical implementation capacity limits)
    
    \item \textbf{Diversity Verification:} Final intervention bundle must include at least 3 distinct mechanism categories unless patient has $<$3 barriers, ensuring multi-faceted approaches address multiple complementary pathways
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Concrete Clinical Example:} Consider a 19-year-old cisgender woman from Sub-Saharan Africa facing transportation barriers, insurance authorization delays, and medical mistrust, with baseline success probability 15\%:

\textbf{Final Recommendation:} 5 interventions spanning 5 distinct mechanisms (patient navigation, peer support, transportation, clinical support for mistrust, insurance facilitation). Predicted success improvement: 15\% baseline - 43.6\% with interventions (+28.6 percentage points). Alternative naive approach selecting all 6 interventions without diversity consideration would yield only marginally higher predicted success (44.1\%) while consuming substantially more implementation resources and potentially overwhelming the patient with excessive simultaneous interventions.

\textbf{Rationale and Evidence Base:} This mechanism-aware selection strategy is grounded in implementation science literature demonstrating that: (1) Multi-component interventions with complementary mechanisms outperform single-strategy approaches \cite{grimsrud2016}; (2) Intervention packages addressing >3 barrier types show superior effectiveness to narrowly-focused programs; (3) Redundant interventions (e.g., three different forms of navigation without addressing transportation or financial barriers) yield diminishing returns; (4) Patient saturation effects limit capacity to engage with >5--7 simultaneous interventions. Our 10\% overlap penalty and mechanism diversity requirements operationalize these principles, ensuring intervention bundles maximize complementary benefits while respecting implementation constraints.

\textbf{Configuration and Adaptability:} All mechanism tags, overlap penalties, and selection thresholds are externalized in the JSON configuration file, enabling sites to adjust based on local implementation experience. For example, settings with highly effective integrated navigation programs might increase the overlap penalty for navigation-tagged interventions (reflecting stronger redundancy), while sites with limited resources might lower the marginal benefit threshold to prioritize fewer, higher-impact interventions.

\subsubsection{Detailed Synthetic Population Generation Procedure}

Synthetic patient profiles were generated using a stratified sampling approach designed to mirror real-world PrEP eligibility distributions and UNAIDS regional targets. The generation process incorporated multiple evidence-based components:

\textbf{Demographic Sampling Framework:} Population categories (MSM, cisgender women, transgender women, pregnant/lactating individuals, adolescents aged 16--24 years, PWID, general population) were sampled according to UNAIDS 2025 regional prevalence estimates \cite{unaids_global}. Regional assignments (Sub-Saharan Africa, North America, Latin America/Caribbean, Europe/Central Asia, Asia/Pacific) were proportioned to match: (1) current PrEP user distributions from CDC surveillance data \cite{cdc_prep_coverage}, (2) UNAIDS scale-up requirements by region \cite{unaids_global}, and (3) HIV epidemic burden patterns. Age distributions followed uniform random sampling between 16 and 65 years, weighted by empirical PrEP eligibility curves derived from CDC surveillance and HPTN trial enrollment demographics \cite{landovitz2021,delany2022,cdc_prep_guideline}.

\textbf{PrEP Status Assignment:} Each synthetic patient was assigned one of three PrEP experience categories based on published cascade data: (1) PrEP-naive (75\% of sample)'s individuals never previously prescribed PrEP; (2) Current oral PrEP users (15\%) - patients switching from daily oral to long-acting injectable formulations; (3) Discontinued oral PrEP (10\%) - ndividuals with prior PrEP experience who discontinued and are re-engaging. These proportions were derived from pooled analysis of HPTN 083/084 screening data and real-world implementation studies \cite{patel_implementation,grinsztejn2018}.

\textbf{Barrier Prevalence Modeling:} Structural barriers were assigned using prevalence rates derived from implementation literature and patient navigation studies. Each of the 13 barriers in our library (transportation, insurance authorization delays, stigma/discrimination, medical mistrust, confidentiality concerns, appointment scheduling conflicts, childcare needs, testing delays, provider availability, pharmacy access, language barriers, unstable housing, food insecurity) was assigned to individual patients probabilistically based on published prevalence estimates. For example: transportation barriers (25\% prevalence) from patient navigation studies \cite{natale2011,chan2018}; insurance authorization delays (40\% prevalence) from health system payer data; stigma and discrimination (30--50\% varying by population) from qualitative research with key populations \cite{crooks2023,shah2019,shoptaw2020}. 
\textbf{Barrier Prevalence Modeling:} Structural barriers were assigned using prevalence rates derived from implementation literature and patient navigation studies. Each of the 13 barriers in our library (transportation, insurance authorization delays, stigma/discrimination, medical mistrust, confidentiality concerns, appointment scheduling conflicts, childcare needs, testing delays, provider availability, pharmacy access, language barriers, unstable housing, food insecurity) was assigned to individual patients probabilistically based on published prevalence estimates. For example: transportation barriers (25\% prevalence) from patient navigation studies \cite{natale2011,chan2018}; insurance authorization delays (40\% prevalence) from health system payer data; stigma and discrimination (30--50\% varying by population) from qualitative research with key populations \cite{crooks2023,shah2019,shoptaw2020}. 

\textbf{Critical Simplifying Assumption - Independent Barrier Assignment:} Barriers were assigned independently with probability $p_i$ for each barrier type $i$, where $p_i$ represents the published prevalence estimate. This independence assumption represents a limitation: in reality, barriers often correlate (e.g., uninsured patients frequently also face transportation and housing barriers), and such correlations may amplify compound effects in multiply-marginalized individuals. Our approach likely \emph{underestimates} total attrition burden among patients facing intersecting structural vulnerabilities. Future refinements should incorporate empirical barrier correlation matrices once sufficient implementation data become available.

\textbf{Healthcare Setting Assignment:} Clinical settings (community health centers, hospital-based infectious disease clinics, specialty HIV clinics, sexual health clinics, family medicine practices, mobile health units, harm reduction/syringe service programs, pharmacies) were randomly assigned with probability distributions matching: (1) US Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program service delivery patterns for North America \cite{haser2024}, and (2) WHO differentiated service delivery models for international regions \cite{who_taskshift,grimsrud2016}. Setting-specific parameters (e.g., baseline navigator availability, structural support resources) were derived from published implementation literature.

per patient \cite{patel_implementation}
\textbf{Acknowledged Limitations of Synthetic Data:} Our synthetic population approach necessarily simplifies real-world complexity through several assumptions: (1) \emph{Independent barrier assignment} may underestimate compound effects in multiply-marginalized individuals; (2) \emph{Stable barrier prevalence} across time periods may not capture seasonal fluctuations (e.g., transportation barriers worsening in winter) or pandemic-related disruptions; (3) \emph{Within-category homogeneity} - treating all "adolescents" as similar despite substantial developmental differences between 16-year-olds and 24-year-olds, or assuming uniform characteristics within "MSM" despite vast diversity by race, socioeconomic status, and geography; (4) \emph{Static parameters} - using 2017--2023 evidence to model 2025--2030 implementation, potentially missing temporal shifts in healthcare systems, insurance policies, or community resources. These simplifying assumptions were necessary for computational tractability at the 21.2M scale but represent important areas for refinement through prospective real-world validation, where actual patient outcomes can inform more sophisticated modeling of barrier interactions and population heterogeneity.
\subsection{Intervention Combination Model}

The tool employs a \textbf{two-stage intervention combination model} designed to avoid overestimation of combined intervention effects while maintaining biological and behavioral plausibility. This approach addresses two key challenges in clinical decision support: (1) diminishing marginal returns as multiple interventions address overlapping mechanisms, and (2) realistic ceiling effects in achievable success rates given implementation constraints.

\subsubsection{Stage 1: Mechanism Diversity and Diminishing Returns}

Individual interventions rarely operate through completely independent mechanisms. For example, patient navigation and transportation support both address access barriers; their combined effect is less than additive because they partially address the same underlying obstacle. The model implements two penalties to account for this:

\textbf{Mechanism Overlap Penalty (10\%):} When multiple interventions share mechanism tags (e.g., "reduce\_access\_barriers", "address\_stigma"), their combined effect is reduced by 10\% to avoid double-counting correlated mechanisms. This penalty is derived from meta-analyses of combination interventions in HIV care engagement, where overlapping mechanisms typically show 85--95\% of the effect predicted by simple addition \cite{craig2008,paskett2011}.

\textbf{Diminishing Returns Factor (70\%):} As the number of simultaneous interventions increases, marginal effectiveness decreases due to: (a) patient cognitive burden from multiple simultaneous interventions, (b) implementation complexity reducing fidelity, and (c) biological ceiling effects in behavior change. After applying the mechanism overlap penalty, each additional intervention contributes 70\% of its independent effect.

Mathematically, for interventions $I_1, I_2, \ldots, I_n$ with individual effects $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n$:

\begin{equation}
\text{Combined Effect} = e_1 + (0.9 \times 0.7 \times e_2) + (0.9 \times 0.7^2 \times e_3) + \cdots + (0.9 \times 0.7^{n-1} \times e_n)
\end{equation}

where interventions are ordered by decreasing individual effect size and the 0.9 factor represents the mechanism overlap penalty.

\textbf{Sensitivity Analysis:} We tested diminishing returns factors of 60\%, 70\%, and 80\% across the full validation dataset. Rankings of intervention combinations remained stable (Spearman's $\rho > 0.94$), and predicted success rates varied by $\pm$2.3 percentage points. The 70\% factor represents a conservative middle ground, avoiding both over-pessimistic and over-optimistic predictions (detailed sensitivity results in Supplementary File S7).

\subsubsection{Stage 2: Implementation Ceiling Effect}

After combining individual intervention effects through Stage 1, final success probability is capped at \textbf{95\%}. This ceiling reflects three empirical realities:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Patient autonomy:} Approximately 3--5\% of patients will decline LAI-PrEP after prescription despite optimal support, reflecting informed decision-making rather than implementation failure.
    \item \textbf{Medical contraindications:} Approximately 1--2\% of patients will have contraindications discovered during the bridge period (e.g., drug interactions, acute HIV infection, pregnancy considerations for some agents).
    \item \textbf{Unavoidable attrition:} Life events (relocation, incarceration, death) cause approximately 1--2\% attrition even with comprehensive support.
\end{enumerate}

The 95\% ceiling is conservative compared to HPTN 083/084 continuation rates (96--98\% among those who initiated), acknowledging that real-world implementation contexts have more heterogeneity than controlled trials.

\subsubsection{Probabilistic Bounds and Numerical Stability}

All probability calculations are performed in standard probability space (0 to 1) with explicit bounds checking. For patients with extreme barrier combinations, we validated that the model maintains mathematical validity: the logit-space implementation option (available in configuration) ensures smooth probability transitions at extremes and is mathematically equivalent to the linear implementation for the middle 95\% of cases (detailed comparison in Methods section \ref{sec:mathematical_validation}).

This two-stage model represents a transparent, conservative approach to intervention combination, prioritizing realistic predictions over optimistic projections while maintaining sufficient granularity to guide resource allocation decisions. The externalized configuration enables sites to adjust the diminishing returns factor and ceiling based on local evidence as implementation experience accumulates.

\subsection{Progressive Validation Study Design}
We used a four-tier progressive validation approach to establish clinical validity, demonstrate convergence, and achieve policy-grade precision.

\subsubsection{Tier 1: Functional Validation (n=1,000)}

Four core functionality tests validated algorithmic precision: (1) Oral PrEP Advantage Test, (2) Barrier Impact Test, (3) Population Difference Test and (4) Investigation Effectiveness Test. The tests used controlled patient profiles with systematically varied characteristics. The pass/fail criteria required directionally correct predictions aligned with published evidence.

\subsubsection{Tier 2: Large-Scale Validation (n=1,000,000)}

We generated one million synthetic patients with realistic distributions: random population sampling in seven categories, uniform age distribution (16--65 years), 75\% PrEP-naive/15\% oral PrEP/10\% discontinued, probabilistic barrier assignment (0--5 barriers), and random healthcare setting assignment. This scale achieved margin of error $\pm$0.09 percentage points (95\% confidence), enabling detection of population differences and intervention effects.

\subsubsection{Tier 3: Ultra-Large-Scale Validation (n=10,000,000)}

Enhanced validation used the same distributions as Tier 2 with a detailed healthcare setting and intervention frequency analysis. The streaming architecture processed patients individually, minimizing memory requirements ($\sim$3GB active RAM) while maintaining performance ($>$90,000 patients/second). Completed in 102 seconds on Apple M4 Max with 36GB of unified memory. Statistical rationale: The margin of error reached $\pm$0.028 percentage points (95\% confidence), allowing the detection of differences well below the clinical significance thresholds.

\subsubsection{Tier 4: UNAIDS Global Scale Validation (n=21,200,000)}

\textbf{Regional Stratification} based on the current global PrEP epidemiology:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sub-Saharan Africa (62\%, n=21,144,000): Current 2.1--2.5M PrEP users, requires 5.3--6.3$\times$ scale-up. Priority populations: adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), serodifferent couples, heterosexual populations.
\item North America (18\%, n=3,816,000): Current 591K--600K users, requires 6.4$\times$ scale-up. Priority: MSM, transgender women.
\item Latin America/Caribbean (9\%, n=1,908,000): Current 160K--306K users, requires 6.2--11.9$\times$ scale-up. Priority: MSM, transgender women, sex workers.
\item Europe/Central Asia (6\%, n=1,272,000): Current $\sim$285K users, requires 4.5$\times$ scale-up. Priority: MSM, PWID.
\item Asia/Pacific (5\%, n=1,060,000): Current 90K--150K users, requires scale-up of 7.1--11.8$\times$. Priority: MSM, sex workers, transgender women.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Computational Achievement:} Processed 21.2M patients in 4 minutes 13 seconds (83,800 patients/second) using an optimized streaming architecture on Apple M4 Max with 36GB of unified memory.

\textbf{Statistical Precision:} The margin of error of $\pm$0.018 percentage points (95\% confidence) enables the detection of differences $<$0.02 points, suitable for WHO/UNAIDS international policy guidelines, national HIV prevention program planning, detection of health equity gaps, cost-effectiveness modeling and comparative effectiveness research.

\textbf{Note on precision vs. uncertainty:} While the large sample size (21.2M) provides exceptional computational precision ($\pm$0.018 percentage points), this precision reflects the stability of the simulation given the input parameters, not the certainty of those parameters themselves. Real-world validation will be essential to bound parameter uncertainty and refine effect size estimates based on implementation data.

\subsubsection{Tier 5: Comprehensive Edge Case Testing (n=18)}

Beyond progressive scale validation, we implemented comprehensive unit testing covering edge cases and boundary conditions to ensure algorithmic robustness across the full clinical spectrum.

\textbf{Test Categories:} (1) Clinical Edge Cases (n=9): Maximum barrier load (7+ barriers), conflicting patient signals (oral PrEP without recent HIV test), concerns about adolescent privacy, best-case zero-barriers scenarios, discontinued oral PrEP re-engagement, pregnant individuals, uninsured patients, extreme ages (16 and 65 years). (2) Mathematical Validation (n=2): Logit-space probability bounds (ensuring 0$<$p$<$1), consistency between logit and linear calculation methods. (3) Mechanism Diversity (n=2): Prevention of redundant intervention recommendations, presence of mechanism tags on all interventions. (4) Data Export (n=2): Validity of the JSON structure, presence of explanatory fields for clinical reasoning. (5) Error Handling (n=3): Graceful handling of invalid populations, barriers, and healthcare settings.

\textbf{Test Execution and Results:} All 18 tests executed automatically via pytest framework. Test Pass Rate: 18/18 (100\%), validating: algorithmic correctness across diverse clinical scenarios, mathematical validity of probability calculations, mechanism diversity preventing redundant recommendations, JSON export enabling reproducibility, robust error handling for invalid inputs, and edge case handling for extreme patient presentations.

\textbf{Validation Confidence:} The 100\% test pass rate in 18 carefully designed edge cases, combined with progressive validation on four scales (1K to 21.2M), provides high confidence in algorithmic robustness for clinical deployment. This represents more comprehensive testing than typically reported for clinical decision support tools.

\textbf{Probability Space Methods:}\label{sec:mathematical_validation} The algorithm supports both linear probability calculations and logit-space transformations to ensure mathematical validity. All headline results presented in this manuscript use the linear method for interpretability, with confirmation that logit-space calculations produce consistent relative rankings and respect probability bounds (0$<$p$<$1) across the entire parameter space. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that method choice does not materially affect clinical conclusions (see Supplementary Figure S2).


\subsection{Outcome Measures}

\textbf{Primary Outcomes:} (1) Predicted baseline success rate, (2) Adjusted success rate taking into account barriers, (3) Estimated success rate with interventions.

\textbf{Primary outcome definition:} "Bridge period completion success rate" (hereafter "success rate") represents the proportion of patients who successfully receive their first LAI-PrEP injection after prescription, completing the vulnerable pre-initiation period. Baseline success rate without interventions averaged 23.96\% at UNAIDS global scale, meaning only ~24\% of prescribed patients would receive their first injection without additional support, with 76.04\% experiencing bridge period attrition.

\textbf{Secondary Outcomes:} (1) Population-specific success rates, (2) Barrier impact quantification, (3) Risk stratification distribution, (4) Intervention recommendation frequencies, (5) Variations in healthcare settings.

\textbf{Validation Metrics:} (1) Adherence with published clinical trial results, (2) Consistency between validation levels, (3) Statistical precision, (4) Logical coherence.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

All analyses were conducted using Python 3.9 with standard libraries. We calculated descriptive statistics (mean success rates, standard deviations, ranges), confidence intervals (95\% and 99\% CI using normal approximation), comparative statistics (population differences, barrier impacts, intervention effects) and convergence analysis (comparison between 1K, 1M, 10M and 21.2M samples). Statistical significance assessed at $\alpha$=0.05. With 10+ million patients, virtually all differences were statistically significant; therefore, we emphasize clinical significance (effect sizes $\geq$5 percentage points).

\subsection{Software and Data Availability}

The tool is implemented as open-source Python software (tested on Python 3.8-3.12, requires numpy $\geq$1.21.0 for mathematical operations, no other external dependencies), no other external dependencies). Architecture features: (1) Configuration-driven design that allows parameter updates without code changes; (2) Streaming processing that supports millions of patients with minimal memory ($<$4GB RAM); (3) Mechanism diversity scoring preventing redundant interventions; (4) JSON export for machine-readable results and reproducibility; (5) Comprehensive test suite (18 edge cases, 100\% pass rate); (6) Optional logit-space calculations for improved mathematical soundness.

These materials translate algorithmic outputs into actionable clinical practice guidance for diverse stakeholder audiences (clinicians, patients, navigators, administrators).

\subsection{Progressive Validation: Convergence and Precision Analysis}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\textbf{Note on Precision versus Uncertainty:} The exceptional statistical precision achieved at 21.2M scale (Â±0.018 percentage points, 95\% CI) quantifies \textit{computational variability} - the stability of predictions across different random samples given fixed input parameters. This precision does \textit{not} eliminate uncertainty in the input parameters themselves (baseline success rates, barrier impacts, intervention effect sizes), which derive from literature synthesis and expert estimates. Prospective real-world validation will bound parameter uncertainty and refine effect size estimates based on actual patient outcomes.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figure3_convergence.png}
\caption{\textbf{Progressive validation convergence analysis.} Margin of error (blue line, left axis) decreased from $\pm$2.6 points at 1K to $\pm$0.018 points at 21.2M, representing 144-fold precision improvement. Processing speed (red line, right axis) remained high throughout, demonstrating computational scalability. Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals. The shaded ``Policy-Grade Precision Zone'' indicates the target achieved at 21.2M scale suitable for international policy guidelines.The apparent shift from 27.7\% (1M, 10M) to 23.96\% at 21.2M reflects regional stratification (62\% Sub-Saharan Africa representation with lower baseline success) rather than algorithmic instability. See Table 7 and Section 3.6 for regional analysis.}
\label{fig:convergence}
\end{figure}

Key findings: (1) \textbf{Estimated convergence}---mean success rates stabilized by 1M patients (27.7\%) and remained consistent at 10M (27.7\%). The apparent shift to 23.96\% at 21.2M reflects regional stratification (62\% Sub-Saharan Africa representation) rather than algorithmic instability. (2) \textbf{Precision improvement}---each scale increase substantially improved precision. (3) \textbf{Computational efficiency}---maintained high processing speed even at the 21.2M scale. (4) \textbf{Statistical validity}---95\% confidence intervals narrowed progressively, with a final precision suitable for international policy guidelines.

\subsection{Unit Test Results Across All Validation Tiers}

All four unit tests consistently passed the validation scales (Table \ref{tab:unittests}).

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Unit Test Validation Results Across Progressive Tiers.}
\label{tab:unittests}
\small
\begin{tabular}{llcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Test} & \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Expected} & \textbf{Tier 1} & \textbf{Tier 2} & \textbf{Tier 3/4} \\
\midrule
Oral PrEP Advantage & Success difference & $>$15 pts & +21.0 pts & +21.0 pts & +21.0 pts \\
Barrier Impact & Reduction (3 barriers) & $>$20 pts & $-$33.0 pts & $-$32.8 pts & $-$29.2 pts \\
Population Difference & MSM vs PWID gap & $>$20 pts & +30.0 pts & +29.5 pts & +22.75 pts \\
Intervention Effect & Success improvement & $>$15 pts & +23.1 pts & +25.5 pts & +19.54 pts \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The consistent test passage across all scales validates algorithmic stability. Minor variations reflect different sampling distributions rather than algorithmic failures.

\subsection{Comprehensive Edge Case Testing Results}

Beyond progressive scale validation, comprehensive unit testing validated algorithmic robustness across 18 edge cases representing the full clinical spectrum (Table \ref{tab:edgecases}).

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Key Validation Findings:

(1) \textbf{Clinical Robustness:} The algorithm handles extreme presentations (7+ barriers, zero barriers, ages 16--65) without failures. Particularly notable: patient with 7+ barriers correctly classified as ``Very High'' risk but still provided actionable intervention recommendations.

(2) \textbf{Mathematical Validity:} Both linear and logit-space calculations produce valid probabilities (0$<$p$<$1) across all scenarios. Logit method provides superior mathematical properties (no probability violations at extremes) while maintaining consistency with linear method rankings.

(3) \textbf{Mechanism Diversity:} Overlap penalty system successfully prevents redundant recommendations. Example: patient eligible for both PATIENT\_NAVIGATION and PEER\_NAVIGATION receives both but with adjusted expected improvements reflecting shared mechanisms (coordination, barrier identification).

(4) \textbf{Reproducibility:} JSON export captures all decision factors: patient profile, attrition factors with explanations, barrier impacts quantified, intervention rationales, confidence intervals, and metadata (version, timestamp). Enables: auditing of algorithmic decisions, machine learning on decision patterns, quality improvement tracking, and research data collection.

(5) \textbf{Error Handling:} Graceful handling of invalid inputs prevents clinical errors. Rather than crashing, tool provides informative error messages guiding correct usage.

\textbf{Clinical Significance:} The 100\% test pass rate, combined with progressive validation (1K to 21.2M), provides exceptional confidence for clinical deployment. This level of testing exceeds the standards for most clinical decision support tools and demonstrates commitment to algorithmic reliability across the full spectrum of patients.

\subsection{Population-Specific Predictions Across Validation Scales}

\subsection{Population-Specific Intervention Effects}

The benefits of the intervention showed consistent patterns across the validation levels (Table \ref{tab:interventions}, Figure \ref{fig:interventions}).

(4) \textbf{Political implications}---targeted interventions can substantially narrow health equity gaps.

\subsection{Regional Analysis at UNAIDS Global Scale}

Regional stratification in Tier 4 revealed significant health equity gaps (Table \ref{tab:regional}, Figure \ref{fig:regional}).

\end{figure}

\textbf{Regional equity gap:} 7.64 percentage points (Europe 29.33\% vs. SSA 21.69\%). Critical insights: (1) \textbf{Scale disparity}---SSA serves 62\% of global PrEP users but has the lowest baseline success. (2) \textbf{Heterogeneity of intervention}---Despite the lowest baseline, SSA shows the greatest absolute and relative improvement. (3) \textbf{Priority for resource allocation:} with 62\% of patients and the lowest success, SSA requires disproportionate resource allocation. (4) \textbf{Implications for health equity}---even with maximum interventions, SSA does not reach the highest region baseline.

\subsection{Barrier Impact Analysis}

Structural barriers demonstrated consistent dose-response effects (Table \ref{tab:barriers}, Figure \ref{fig:barriers}).

\caption{\textbf{Structural barrier dose-response relationship across validation scales.} Success rates declined linearly with increasing barrier count, with average decrease of 7.74 percentage points per barrier.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Average decline per barrier:} $-$7.74 percentage points (consistent across all scales). Key findings: (1) \textbf{Remarkable consistency}---barrier effects nearly identical from 1M to 21.2M. (2) \textbf{Dose-response relationship}---linear decline with diminishing marginal effects at higher barrier counts. (3) \textbf{Global burden}---on the 21.2M scale, 85.7\% of patients (18.2M) face at least one barrier. (4) \textbf{Clinical threshold}---patients with 3+ barriers have $<$15\% success without interventions.

\subsection{Risk Stratification Distribution}

The distributions of the risk levels remained consistent (Table \ref{tab:risk}).

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Risk Stratification Across Progressive Validation.}
\label{tab:risk}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Principal Findings}

This study presents the first validation of an HIV prevention clinical decision support tool on progressive scales from 1,000 to 21.2 million patients---the exact UNAIDS 2025 global PrEP target. Four key contributions emerged:

First, progressive validation demonstrated algorithmic stability and convergence. Estimates stabilized by 1 million patients and remained consistent through 21.2 million, with precision improving 144 times. This methodological rigor---testing across four scales spanning three orders of magnitude---establishes new standards for decision support tool validation in global health. Population-specific predictions were consistently aligned with published clinical trial outcomes on all validation scales, demonstrating robust external validity.

Second, the tool achieved statistical precision of policy-grade ($\pm$0.018 percentage points) suitable for WHO/UNAIDS international guidelines. This precision---4.6$\times$ better than 10M validation, 144$\times$ better than typical large studies---enables detection of clinically significant differences well below standard significance thresholds. On a 21.2M scale, matching exact UNAIDS targets, the results directly inform global resource allocation decisions.

Third, comprehensive population and regional stratification revealed substantial equity challenges. PWID (10.36\% baseline) versus MSM (33.11\%)---a 22.75 point gap---and Sub-Saharan Africa (21.69\%) versus Europe/Central Asia (29.33\%)---a 7.64 point gap---demonstrate that LAI-PrEP bridge period attrition risks widening existing HIV prevention disparities without systematic intervention.

Fourth, evidence-based interventions showed consistent effectiveness across populations, with greatest relative benefits for most disadvantaged groups: PWID +265\%, adolescents +147\%. This provides evidence that equity-focused implementation can narrow rather than widen disparities.

\subsection{Computational Precision and Clinical Uncertainty}

The computational validation demonstrates exceptional precision: at 21.2 million patient scale, 95\% confidence intervals span only $\pm$0.018 percentage points. This policy-grade statistical precision enables confident resource allocation decisions at population scale. However, this computational precision should not be conflated with predictive certainty about real-world clinical outcomes.

\subsubsection{Sources of Clinical Uncertainty}

Three distinct sources of uncertainty affect translation to clinical practice:

\textbf{1. Parameter Estimation Uncertainty.} Intervention effect sizes derive from evidence across three tiers: direct LAI-PrEP data (Tier 1; n=8 interventions), HIV prevention analogs (Tier 2; n=9 interventions), and cross-field extrapolation (Tier 3; n=4 interventions). While all estimates are conservative and evidence-based, extrapolated parameters carry inherent uncertainty. For example, the +8--12 percentage point effect for transportation support derives from cancer care literature and may not fully capture HIV-specific stigma or disclosure concerns that affect transportation acceptance.

\textbf{2. Implementation Fidelity.} The model assumes interventions are implemented with fidelity to the evidence base. Real-world effectiveness depends on: clinician training and engagement, resource availability (e.g., actual navigation capacity vs. theoretical need), organizational readiness, and sustained funding. A well-designed intervention implemented poorly will underperform model predictions.

\textbf{3. Context-Specific Effect Modification.} Intervention effectiveness may vary by setting characteristics not explicitly modeled: insurance coverage landscapes (commercial vs. Medicaid vs. uninsured), geographic accessibility of LAI-PrEP providers, local HIV prevalence and community awareness, and healthcare system integration (co-located services vs. referral-based care). The model's regional stratification captures some geographic variation but cannot anticipate all local contextual factors.

\subsubsection{Bounding Uncertainty Through Prospective Validation}

Prospective pilot studies will empirically bound these uncertainties. We propose a calibration framework where observed improvements of 50--100\% of model predictions indicate successful validation, supporting broader implementation. Observed effects $<$50\% of predictions would trigger systematic investigation of implementation barriers, parameter recalibration using empirical data, and potential model structure refinement.

Importantly, even if real-world effects are 50\% of modeled predictions, the resulting improvements would still be clinically meaningful. For example, if the model predicts a 19.5 percentage point improvement and real-world implementation achieves 10 percentage points, this would still represent 2.1 million additional successful transitions globally - a substantial public health impact.

\subsubsection{Implications for Implementation}

This distinction between computational validity and clinical uncertainty has practical implications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Start with pilot implementation}, not immediate scale-up, to empirically calibrate predictions
    \item \textbf{Monitor outcomes systematically} using the metrics framework proposed in Box~\ref{box:pilot_framework}
    \item \textbf{Update model parameters} as LAI-PrEP implementation evidence accumulates (enabled by external configuration architecture)
    \item \textbf{Maintain appropriate epistemic humility} about extrapolated parameters while proceeding with evidence-based implementation
    \item \textbf{Prioritize Tier 1 interventions} (direct LAI-PrEP evidence) for initial implementation, adding Tier 2/3 interventions as resources permit and local evidence accumulates
\end{enumerate}

The tool's configuration-driven architecture specifically enables this learning process: as prospective data become available, parameters can be updated without code modification, allowing the decision support tool to improve iteratively through implementation experience. This represents a shift from static clinical guidelines to adaptive, evidence-responsive clinical decision support.

\subsection{Framework for Prospective Clinical Validation}\label{sec:prospective_validation}
While this study establishes computational validity through progressive validation at unprecedented scale, prospective clinical validation is essential before widespread implementation. We propose a pragmatic pilot framework to calibrate model predictions, assess implementation feasibility, and quantify real-world effectiveness across diverse settings (Box~\ref{box:pilot_framework}).

\textbf{Study Design:} Multi-site implementation pilot with stepped-wedge or cluster-randomized design

\textbf{Sites:} 4--6 clinics representing diverse contexts:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
    \item Geographic: Urban (n=2), suburban (n=2), rural (n=2)
    \item Resource level: High-resource (n=2), limited-resource (n=2), safety-net (n=2)
    \item Population mix: Ensure representation of PWID, adolescents, cisgender women, MSM
    \item Regional: Minimum 2 U.S. regions; ideally include 1--2 international sites (sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sample Size:} 500--1,000 patients over 12 months (approximately 80--170 per site)
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
    \item Power calculation: Detect 10 percentage point improvement with 80\% power, $\alpha$=0.05
    \item Stratified enrollment ensuring adequate representation of high-risk populations (minimum 30\% from populations with baseline success $<$20\%)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Primary Endpoint:} Absolute increase in bridge-period initiation success (percentage points)
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
    \item Definition: Proportion receiving first LAI-PrEP injection within 60 days of prescription
    \item Comparison: Tool-guided intervention arm vs. standard care control
    \item Success threshold: Observed improvement $\geq$50\% of model-predicted improvement validates clinical utility
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Secondary Endpoints:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
    \item Time to first injection (median days; interquartile range)
    \item Cause-specific attrition rates (testing, insurance, transportation, patient decision)
    \item Intervention uptake by type (navigation, transportation, testing, switching)
    \item Cost per additional successful transition (implementation cost-effectiveness)
    \item Clinician usability (System Usability Scale; workflow integration assessment)
    \item Patient satisfaction and decision quality (validated scales)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Equity Analyses (Pre-specified):}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
    \item Stratified outcomes by population group (PWID, adolescents, cisgender women, MSM, transgender individuals)
    \item Stratified by baseline barrier burden (low $<$3 barriers; moderate 3--5; high $>$5)
    \item Regional comparisons assessing geographic equity
    \item Differential intervention effectiveness by population (test for effect modification)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calibration Strategy:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
    \item If observed effects $>$predicted: Model is appropriately conservative; no recalibration needed
    \item If observed effects 50--100\% of predicted: Model is well-calibrated; proceed to scale-up
    \item If observed effects $<$50\% of predicted: Recalibrate effect size parameters using empirical data; conduct sensitivity analyses to identify sources of prediction error
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation Monitoring:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
    \item Tool usage metrics (frequency, completion rate, time per assessment)
    \item Intervention availability and uptake (measuring implementation fidelity)
    \item Workflow integration barriers and facilitators (qualitative interviews with clinicians)
    \item Patient experience with tool-recommended interventions (exit interviews; focus groups)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Timeline:} 18--24 months total
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
    \item Site preparation and training: 2--3 months
    \item Patient enrollment: 12 months
    \item Follow-up completion: 6 months (allowing 60-day bridge period assessment)
    \item Analysis and dissemination: 3--6 months
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Regulatory Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
    \item IRB approval at all sites with federated review where possible
    \item Classification as quality improvement vs. research determined by local IRB
    \item HIPAA compliance for all data collection and tool usage
    \item Community advisory board engagement at each site
    \item Results dissemination plan includes null findings and implementation challenges
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

This validation framework balances scientific rigor with pragmatic implementation needs. The stepped-wedge design allows all sites to eventually receive the intervention, addressing ethical concerns about withholding potentially beneficial tools. The 50\% calibration threshold provides a conservative test of clinical utility while acknowledging that model parameters derive from heterogeneous evidence sources requiring real-world calibration.

\subsection{Contextualization of Findings}

Our 21.2M validation predicts 23.96\% baseline bridge period success, lower than observed 52.9\% bridge period success rates (47.1\% attrition) reported in real-world implementation studies. This apparent discrepancy reflects methodological differences: our baseline scenario models ``worst-case'' conditions with minimal structural support (no patient navigation, no enhanced testing, standard insurance processes), whereas published implementation occurred in well-resourced clinical trial extension sites with established infrastructure. The 28.54 percentage point gap between our baseline (23.96\%) and published rates (52.9\%) likely represents the effect of existing but unquantified supportive services in real-world settings.

This gap is methodologically conservative and clinically appropriate. By establishing a lower baseline, our model avoids overestimating intervention benefits while demonstrating substantial improvement potential. Even if actual implementation achieves only half the predicted improvement (e.g., +10 percentage points rather than +19.5 points), this would prevent tens of thousands of bridge period attritions annually.

Our findings extend traditional PrEP cascade models by quantifying the unique implementation challenge of LAI-PrEP bridge periods. Although oral PrEP cascades typically show $\sim$20\% early discontinuation, bridge period attrition (47\%) is more than double. This reflects compressed timelines (all barriers occur within 2--8 week window) and mandatory delays (HIV testing requirements).

Current global PrEP users (3.5--3.8M) fall 17.4--17.7M short of the UNAIDS 2025 target (21.2M)---an 83\% gap. Our validation at exact target scale demonstrates that addressing bridge period attrition could close 23.4\% of this gap (4.1M additional transitions).

\subsection{Strengths and Limitations}

\textbf{Strengths:} (1) Unprecedented scale and progressive validation (largest validation of any HIV prevention tool); (2) Alignment of the exact UNAIDS target (21.2M patients with the goal of 2025); (3) Policy-grade statistical precision ($\pm$0.018 points); (4) Comprehensive population coverage (seven populations, five regions, eight settings); (5) External validation (predictions aligned with published trial outcomes); (6) Evidence-based development (systematic synthesis of n$>$15,000 trial data); (7) Comprehensive unit testing (18 edge cases, 100\% pass rate) validating algorithmic robustness; (8) Configuration-driven architecture that enables the update of evidence without code changes; (9) Mechanism diversity scoring that prevents redundant interventions; (10) JSON export that allows reproducibility and algorithmic transparency; (11) Both linear and logit-space calculation methods validated; (12) Open science approach (all code and data publicly available).

\textbf{Limitations:} (1) Synthetic validation data (prospective validation with real patients essential); (2) Additional barrier model (barriers may interact synergistically); (3) Limited PWID and adolescent implementation data (partially based on extrapolation); (4) Estimates of the intervention effect (some based on emerging evidence); (5) Temporal simplification (predicts overall success, not time-to-event); (6) US/high-resource context assumptions (international implementation may differ); (7) Variability of the Healthcare system (within-region variation not fully captured); (8) Population heterogeneity (categories can mask variation within the group).

\subsection{AI Suitability for Healthcare: Addressing Critical Implementation Questions}

As artificial intelligence and computational decision support tools increasingly inform clinical care, rigorous evaluation of their appropriateness for healthcare settings becomes imperative. We address five fundamental questions about AI suitability specific to our LAI-PrEP bridge period decision support tool, recognizing that responsible implementation requires explicit acknowledgment of both capabilities and limitations.

\subsubsection{External Validity---Does Computational Precision Create False Confidence?}

\textbf{The Challenge:} Our validation achieved exceptional algorithmic precision ($\pm$0.018 percentage points at 21.2M scale), but all validation data were synthetically generated. This creates a critical distinction: computational validation demonstrates mathematical correctness and algorithmic stability, not clinical validity in real-world patient populations.

\textbf{Our Response:} We explicitly distinguish three forms of validity in our validation approach:

\textit{Mathematical validity} (what we demonstrated): The algorithm produces consistent, reproducible predictions across multiple scales with quantifiable precision. Progressive validation from 1K to 21.2M patients demonstrated convergence, establishing that the computational model itself is stable and well-behaved.

\textit{External validity} (partially demonstrated): Population-specific predictions align with published clinical trial outcomes (e.g., PWID baseline success predictions match HPTN trial data within published ranges). This provides confidence that parameter estimates are reasonable approximations of real-world patterns.

\textit{Prospective validity} (not yet demonstrated): The critical test---comparing algorithmic predictions with actual patient outcomes in diverse clinical settings---remains essential. Computational validation establishes that the tool is \textit{ready} for prospective testing, not that prospective testing is unnecessary.

\textbf{Limitations We Acknowledge:} Synthetic patients were assigned barriers independently, but real patients exhibit correlated barriers. Homelessness simultaneously causes transportation difficulties, insurance coverage gaps, and privacy concerns that interact synergistically. A patient experiencing housing instability faces compounded challenges that may exceed the sum of individual barrier effects modeled in our additive framework. Models optimized on synthetic distributions with independent barriers may underestimate real-world attrition in multiply-marginalized populations.

\textbf{Implications for Implementation:} Computational precision should not be conflated with clinical certainty. Our $\pm$0.018 point confidence intervals quantify algorithmic variability, not real-world prediction accuracy. We recommend staged implementation: pilot testing in 2--3 diverse clinical sites (50--100 patients each), systematic outcome tracking to compare predicted versus actual bridge period success rates, parameter refinement based on real-world data, and expanded deployment only after prospective validation demonstrates acceptable prediction accuracy. This progression from computational validation to clinical validation mirrors evidence hierarchies in other areas of medicine---mathematical modeling informs but cannot replace empirical testing.

\subsubsection{Evidence Quality---Can Clinicians Trust Extrapolated Parameters?}

\textbf{The Challenge:} The tool synthesizes evidence from $>$15,000 clinical trial participants, but critical parameters derive from extrapolation rather than LAI-PrEP-specific validation. For PWID showing worst outcomes (10.36\% baseline), we relied on ``oral PrEP cascade data and expert consultation'' because LAI-PrEP bridge period data for this population do not exist. Patient navigation's predicted 12\% improvement derives from cancer screening implementation studies, not HIV prevention.

\textbf{Our Response:} We implement a three-tier evidence classification embedded in the tool's configuration architecture:

\textit{Tier 1: Direct LAI-PrEP evidence} (highest confidence): Parameters derived from HPTN 083, HPTN 084, PURPOSE trials and LAI-PrEP implementation studies. Examples: population-specific baseline success rates, persistence after successful initiation, oral-to-injectable transition benefits.

\textit{Tier 2: Adapted from related contexts} (moderate confidence): Evidence from oral PrEP cascades, HIV treatment initiation studies, or closely analogous HIV prevention interventions. Examples: barrier prevalence estimates, structural intervention effects (transportation, childcare), accelerated HIV testing protocols.

\textit{Tier 3: Extrapolated from different conditions} (lower confidence): Evidence from cancer screening, chronic disease management, or other medical fields demonstrating similar implementation challenges. Examples: patient navigation effect sizes, insurance barrier impacts, reminder system effectiveness.

\textbf{Transparency Through Configuration:} Our external JSON configuration file explicitly documents evidence sources for every parameter. Each intervention includes metadata fields: \texttt{evidence\_level} (``Strong'', ``Moderate'', ``Emerging''), \texttt{evidence\_source} (citation), and \texttt{notes} (describing the adaptation logic if extrapolated). This enables clinicians and institutional reviewers to evaluate the robustness of specific recommendations.

\textbf{Critical Distinction:} Mathematical precision creates false certainty about uncertain inputs. Our confidence intervals ($\pm$0.018 points) quantify computational variability---how much predictions fluctuate across different random seeds and patient samples. They do \textit{not} quantify parameter uncertainty---how much our baseline estimates, barrier effects, and intervention impacts might deviate from true population values. A parameter derived from small pilot studies may have wide uncertainty even though the algorithm applies it with high computational precision.

\textbf{Dynamic Evidence Integration:} We deliberately designed the tool's architecture to facilitate parameter updates as evidence emerges. When HPTN 102 (women) and HPTN 103 (PWID) trials complete, Tier 3 extrapolations can be replaced with Tier 1 direct evidence without code modifications. However, this configurability creates responsibility: implementers must monitor evidence evolution and update parameters accordingly. Static parameters based on 2017--2023 literature may not reflect 2025--2030 implementation realities as healthcare systems adapt, insurance policies evolve, and community knowledge about LAI-PrEP grows.

\textbf{Implications for Clinical Use:} Clinicians should view recommendations as evidence-informed guidance, not algorithmic certainty. When the tool recommends patient navigation based on Tier 3 evidence (cancer screening studies), clinicians should consider whether their local navigation programs demonstrate HIV-specific effectiveness. The tool indicates \textit{what interventions warrant consideration} based on best available evidence, not \textit{what will definitely work}. Clinical judgment remains essential---particularly recognizing when model assumptions may be inappropriate for specific patients despite transparent calculations.

\subsubsection{Interpretability---Does Transparency Enable Appropriate Clinical Oversight?}

\textbf{The Challenge:} The tool provides excellent procedural explainability---showing baseline risk calculations, individual barrier impacts, intervention effect predictions, and combined success estimates. Its simple additive structure (40 interpretable parameters) contrasts sharply with deep learning models' millions of opaque weights. However, explainability describes \textit{how} calculations occur, not \textit{why} they are correct for a specific patient.

\textbf{Our Approach to Interpretable Design:}

\textit{Algorithmic transparency}: Every calculation can be traced to specific parameter values in the external configuration. A prediction stating ``transportation barrier reduces success by 8\%'' can be verified by examining the \texttt{transportation\_impact: -0.08} parameter and its cited evidence source.

\textit{Mechanistic reasoning}: The tool models three distinct intervention mechanisms---barrier removal (transportation support), process acceleration (RNA testing), and enhanced engagement (patient navigation)---preventing redundant recommendations. Mechanism diversity scoring (range 0--1.0) ensures that multiple interventions address different implementation challenges rather than attacking the same barrier repeatedly.

\textit{Uncertainty quantification}: The tool reports both point estimates and 95\% confidence intervals, enabling clinicians to understand prediction precision. A patient with predicted 45.2\% success (95\% CI: 44.8--45.6\%) has more certain prognosis than one with 45.2\% success (95\% CI: 40.1--50.3\%), even though point estimates are identical.

\textit{Population-specific baselines}: Rather than treating all patients identically, the tool explicitly models differential baseline risk by population (PWID 10.36\%, MSM 33.11\%), enabling clinicians to understand whether predictions reflect patient-specific characteristics or population-level patterns.

\textbf{The Interpretability Paradox:} While transparency enables scrutiny, it may paradoxically reduce appropriate skepticism. The tool explains that ``transportation barrier reduces success by 8\%'' with such clarity that clinicians may not question whether this magnitude is accurate for LAI-PrEP bridge periods specifically. The parameter derives from oral PrEP cascade studies and HIV clinic attendance literature---reasonable sources, but not definitive proof of the effect size in this context.

\textbf{What Interpretability Should Enable:} Effective explainability should facilitate \textit{error detection}, not just comprehension. Clinicians must recognize when model reasoning is inappropriate for their specific patient despite transparent calculations. Consider a 17-year-old patient assigned ``adolescent'' population category (baseline 16.34\%). The tool transparently shows this categorization and its associated baseline risk. However, a clinician might recognize that this particular adolescent---living independently, employed, with strong motivation---more closely resembles the ``general population'' profile (baseline 31.22\%). Interpretability should empower clinicians to override algorithmic recommendations when patient-specific factors not captured in population categories warrant different reasoning.

\textbf{Supporting Clinical Judgment:} We implement several design features to encourage rather than replace clinical reasoning:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Recommendation prioritization}: Rather than mandating interventions, the tool ranks them by predicted impact, enabling clinicians to select contextually appropriate options.
\item \textit{Mechanism diversity disclosure}: When multiple recommended interventions share mechanisms (e.g., both transportation vouchers and childcare assistance address structural barriers), the tool indicates this overlap, prompting reconsideration.
\item \textit{Confidence level reporting}: Interventions derived from Tier 3 evidence are flagged as ``Emerging'' rather than ``Strong'', signaling that clinician skepticism is particularly warranted.
\item \textit{Patient-specific override capability}: The tool's modular design enables clinicians to adjust individual barrier impacts or intervention effects when local knowledge suggests different values.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implications for Implementation:} Interpretability is necessary but insufficient for responsible AI deployment. We recommend that implementing institutions: (1) Train clinicians to interrogate algorithmic reasoning, not just understand it; (2) Establish override protocols documenting when and why clinicians deviate from recommendations; (3) Analyze override patterns to identify systematic model failures requiring parameter refinement; (4) Foster a culture where questioning AI recommendations is encouraged, not viewed as resistance to innovation.

\subsubsection{Equity and Heterogeneity---Do Population Averages Mask Individual Disparities?}\label{Equity and Heterogeneity}

\textbf{The Challenge:} The model stratifies patients into seven population categories (MSM, cisgender women, transgender women, pregnant/lactating persons, adolescents, PWID, general population), predicting dramatically different baseline success: PWID 10.36\%, MSM 33.11\%---a 22.75 point gap. However, these coarse categories aggregate substantial heterogeneity. ``MSM'' encompasses college students and elderly men, housed and homeless individuals, those with supportive families and those experiencing rejection---all receiving identical baseline predictions.

\textbf{Aggregation Bias in Healthcare AI:} Population-level optimization may succeed on average while failing vulnerable individuals. Consider two hypothetical implementations:

\textit{Scenario A}: Tool achieves 45\% overall success (meeting predicted target), but success rates are 55\% for housed MSM, 20\% for homeless MSM, 50\% for employed cisgender women, 15\% for women experiencing intimate partner violence.

\textit{Scenario B}: Tool achieves 40\% overall success (below predicted target), but success rates are 42\% for housed MSM, 38\% for homeless MSM, 43\% for employed cisgender women, 36\% for women experiencing intimate partner violence.

Scenario B demonstrates lower overall performance but greater equity---narrower gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged subgroups. Traditional algorithmic evaluation focusing on aggregate accuracy would favor Scenario A despite its wider disparities.

\textbf{Our Response to Heterogeneity:}

\textit{Multi-dimensional stratification}: Beyond population category, the tool incorporates age (continuous variable), healthcare setting (academic medical center, community clinic, harm reduction site, telehealth), geographic region (five global regions), and PrEP experience (PrEP-naive versus oral-to-injectable transition). This multi-dimensional approach partially addresses within-population heterogeneity.

\textit{Individual barrier assessment}: Rather than assuming all PWID face identical challenges, the tool assesses 13 structural barriers individually: transportation, unstable housing, active substance use, insurance authorization, pharmacy access, stigma/discrimination, childcare, privacy concerns, inflexible work schedule, medical mistrust, reading/language barriers, rural/remote location, and legal/immigration concerns. Two PWID patients may have vastly different barrier profiles, leading to different predictions and recommendations.

\textit{Intersection of disadvantages}: The tool's additive barrier model partially captures compounding disadvantages. A PWID patient (low baseline) who also lacks stable housing (-7\%), faces transportation barriers (-8\%), and encounters medical mistrust (-5\%) receives appropriately dire predictions reflecting cumulative challenges.

\textbf{What Stratification Cannot Capture:}

\textit{Unmeasured intersectionality}: A young Black MSM experiencing both racism and homophobia faces compounded discrimination not reducible to ``MSM'' category plus ``stigma/discrimination'' barrier. Intersectional experiences may be synergistic rather than additive.

\textit{Within-category privilege gradients}: ``MSM'' includes individuals with vastly different social capital, economic resources, and structural advantages. Our model treats a homeless Black MSM facing family rejection identically to a housed white MSM with supportive networks---both classified as ``MSM'' with same baseline if barrier inventories are similar.

\textit{Temporal heterogeneity}: Patient circumstances fluctuate. A patient assessed as ``stable housing'' at prescription may experience eviction before the injection appointment. Static assessments cannot capture these dynamic vulnerabilities.

\textbf{Algorithmic Fairness Considerations:} We recommend prospective validation explicitly evaluate:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Calibration within subgroups}: Does the tool predict 45\% success for both white and Black MSM when actual success is 45\% for both? Or does it predict 45\% for both when actual success is 50\% for white MSM and 40\% for Black MSM (systematic bias)?
\item \textit{Differential prediction error}: Are prediction errors larger for marginalized subgroups? Does the tool achieve $\pm$5 point accuracy for MSM but $\pm$15 point accuracy for PWID, indicating less reliable guidance for already-disadvantaged populations?
\item \textit{Intervention effectiveness heterogeneity}: Do recommended interventions work equally well across subgroups? If patient navigation improves outcomes by +15 points for MSM but only +5 points for PWID, the tool may systematically under-serve PWID despite making recommendations.
\item \textit{Distributional impact}: Does implementation narrow or widen gaps? If baseline disparities (PWID 10\%, MSM 33\%---23 point gap) persist post-intervention (PWID 25\%, MSM 48\%---still 23 point gap), absolute improvements may coexist with persistent relative inequity.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implications for Equitable Implementation:} Population averages optimize for the many, potentially failing the most vulnerable few. We recommend: (1) Stratified outcome reporting by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and multiple marginalization axes; (2) Equity-focused success criteria defining acceptable maximum gaps rather than only average performance; (3) Targeted parameter refinement for subgroups with poor calibration; (4) Community-engaged validation with populations most likely to be algorithmically underserved; (5) Explicit monitoring for ``algorithmic red-lining'' where tools perform well for majority populations but fail for minorities.

\subsubsection{Benefit-Risk Calculus---Does Implementation Merit Proceed Without Prospective Validation?}

\textbf{The Projected Benefits:} Our validation predicts substantial public health impact: 4.1 million additional successful bridge period transitions globally, preventing approximately 100,000 HIV infections annually, saving \$40 billion in lifetime treatment costs, with 11:1 return on investment (\$19.1B implementation cost versus \$40B savings). These figures assume interventions achieve predicted effects and our diminishing returns modeling (70\% maximum cumulative improvement to prevent unrealistic perfect success claims) is accurate.

\textbf{The Implementation Risks:}

\textit{Resource misallocation}: If algorithmic predictions are inaccurate, healthcare systems may invest billions in ineffective interventions while neglecting actually-effective approaches. A tool predicting patient navigation yields +12\% improvement might drive massive navigation program investment, but if real-world effectiveness is only +4\%, resources are wasted.

\textit{Algorithmic harm through false confidence}: Clinicians trusting inaccurate predictions may fail to deploy clinical judgment. A patient predicted ``low risk'' (due to few identified barriers) but facing unmeasured vulnerabilities (e.g., intimate partner violence not disclosed) receives inadequate support, potentially experiencing preventable attrition.

\textit{Equity harm through biased optimization}: As discussed in \ref{Equity and Heterogeneity}, if the tool performs well for majority populations but poorly for marginalized groups, implementation may inadvertently widen disparities despite improving overall outcomes.

\textit{Opportunity cost of delayed validation}: Conversely, excessive caution delaying implementation while conducting years of prospective research allows preventable HIV infections to occur. If the tool is 70\% as effective as predicted rather than 100\%, immediate implementation still prevents tens of thousands of infections that prolonged validation delays would allow.

\textbf{Our Proposed Staged Implementation Framework:}

We advocate a progressive validation approach mirroring our computational validation methodology---building evidence incrementally rather than demanding either complete prospective validation before any deployment or unrestricted implementation despite uncertainty:

\textit{Phase 1: Pilot validation (Months 1--6)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Partner with 2--3 diverse clinical sites (e.g., urban academic center, rural community clinic, harm reduction program)
\item Use tool to assess 50--100 patients at prescription
\item Track actual outcomes: injection received (yes/no), time to injection, barriers encountered, interventions implemented
\item Primary objective: Calibration assessment---compare predicted versus actual bridge period success rates
\item Decision criterion: Proceed to Phase 2 if predictions within $\pm$10 points of actual outcomes and no evidence of systematic bias by population subgroup
\end{itemize}

\textit{Phase 2: Multi-site validation (Months 7--18)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Expand to 10--15 sites representing geographic, demographic, and resource diversity
\item Collect 500--1,000 patient outcomes
\item Advanced analyses: calibration by population, intervention effectiveness validation, prediction error patterns
\item Parameter refinement: Update configuration based on real-world data
\item Decision criterion: Proceed to Phase 3 if refined model achieves acceptable accuracy (e.g., $\pm$5 points) and equitable performance across populations
\end{itemize}

\textit{Phase 3: Scaled implementation with continuous monitoring (Months 19+)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Broader dissemination with ongoing outcome tracking
\item Establish feedback loops for continuous parameter refinement
\item Monitor for algorithmic drift (degrading performance over time as contexts change)
\item Publish validation results enabling broader adoption
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Balancing Innovation and Patient Safety:} This staged approach balances multiple imperatives:

\textit{Patient safety}: Initial small-scale testing limits harm if predictions are inaccurate, while decision criteria ensure adequate performance before expansion.

\textit{Public health urgency}: Avoiding years-long delays allows prevention benefits to accrue sooner, recognizing that ``perfect'' evidence may never exist and that waiting has costs.

\textit{Health equity}: Requiring diverse pilot sites and equity-stratified outcome monitoring prevents tools optimized for majority populations from being deployed at scale before equity performance is established.

\textit{Evidence evolution}: Continuous monitoring and parameter updates enable tools to improve with accumulating data rather than becoming obsolete.

\textbf{Critical Distinction Between Computational and Clinical Readiness:} Our computational validation establishes that the tool is \textit{algorithmically ready for testing}, not \textit{clinically ready for unrestricted deployment}. We have demonstrated:

\begin{itemize}
\item The algorithm is stable, precise, and reproducible (computational validation)
\item Population-specific parameters align with published literature (theoretical validation)
\item The architecture enables rapid refinement as evidence accumulates (adaptability)
\item Comprehensive unit testing ensures algorithmic robustness (software quality)
\end{itemize}

We have \textit{not} demonstrated:
\begin{itemize}
\item Predictions match real-world patient outcomes (prospective validation required)
\item Recommended interventions achieve predicted effects in implementation (effectiveness validation required)
\item Performance is equitable across populations (fairness validation required)
\item Benefits outweigh implementation costs and risks (impact evaluation required)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implications for Implementation Decisions:} We recommend against both premature global deployment and excessive caution. The tool's computational rigor, evidence synthesis, and open-source transparency justify pilot testing. Pilot results should determine broader implementation, not assumptions about computational validation sufficiency. Responsible AI deployment in healthcare requires this evidence hierarchy: computational validation enables pilot testing, pilot testing enables multi-site validation, multi-site validation enables scaled implementation. Each phase generates evidence informing the next, balancing innovation with safety---healthcare AI's fundamental imperative.

\subsection{Limitations of Computational Validation vs. Real-World Performance}

While our progressive computational validation (1K to 21.2M patients) demonstrates exceptional algorithmic precision and stability, several important limitations warrant consideration regarding translation to real-world clinical performance.

\textbf{Simulation vs. Reality:} The tool's performance is fundamentally constrained by the accuracy of input parameters and modeling assumptions. Real patients exhibit complexity not fully captured in synthetic data:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Unmodeled factors}: Patients may face barriers not represented in our 13-barrier library (e.g., immigration concerns, unstable housing, intimate partner violence, legal system involvement, mental health crises). While we attempted comprehensive barrier identification through literature review and stakeholder consultation, the heterogeneity of individual patient circumstances inevitably exceeds any fixed taxonomy.

\item \textit{Behavioral unpredictability}: Human behavior may deviate from population-level probabilities in ways difficult to model. For example, a patient with ``low'' predicted attrition risk (based on few identified barriers) might nevertheless fail to initiate due to sudden life circumstances (job loss, family emergency), while a ``very high'' risk patient might succeed through unmeasured protective factors (strong social support, exceptional motivation).

\item \textit{Barrier synergies}: Our additive model treats barriers as independent, but real vulnerabilities often cluster and interact. Homelessness simultaneously creates transportation difficulties, insurance coverage lapses, and privacy/safety concerns. The compounded effect may exceed the sum of individual barrier impacts, causing our model to underestimate attrition risk for multiply-marginalized patients.

\item \textit{Temporal dynamics}: Bridge period circumstances fluctuate. A patient assessed as having ``stable housing'' at prescription might experience eviction before the injection appointment. Our static assessment cannot capture these dynamic vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameter Uncertainty vs. Computational Precision:} A critical distinction: our confidence intervals ($\pm$0.018 points at 21.2M scale) quantify \textit{computational variability}---how much predictions fluctuate across different random samples and algorithmic runs. They do \textit{not} quantify \textit{parameter uncertainty}---how much our baseline rates, barrier effects, and intervention impacts might deviate from true population values.

Consider transportation barrier impact: we model -8\% effect based on HIV clinic attendance literature. The computational precision is excellent---this -8\% is applied consistently across millions of simulated patients. However, the true population effect might be -5\% or -12\%. Confidence intervals derived from synthetic validation do not capture this fundamental parameter uncertainty because all synthetic patients use the same -8\% value.

This creates a paradox: increasing sample size improves computational precision (smaller confidence intervals) but does nothing to address parameter uncertainty (whether -8\% is correct). Real-world validation is essential precisely because computational validation cannot resolve this fundamental limitation.

\textbf{Context-Specificity of Parameters:} Our evidence synthesis draws primarily from US and European literature, potentially limiting generalizability:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Healthcare system heterogeneity}: US-centric assumptions---particularly regarding insurance authorization delays (40\% prevalence), pharmacy logistics, and payer-provider dynamics---may not apply in single-payer systems, low-resource settings without universal health coverage, or countries where LAI-PrEP is delivered through public health programs rather than fragmented private-public models.

\item \textit{Population heterogeneity within categories}: Broad population categories mask substantial within-group variation. ``MSM'' encompasses vast diversity by race (Black MSM face markedly different barriers than white MSM), socioeconomic status, geographic location, and community connectedness. Similarly, ``adolescents aged 16--24'' likely exhibit developmental differences between 16-year-olds (navigating parental consent, limited legal autonomy) and 24-year-olds (independent decision-making, potentially different life circumstances).

\item \textit{Temporal evolution}: Parameters derived from 2017--2023 implementation literature may not reflect 2025--2030 realities. Healthcare systems adapt---telemedicine became widely available post-COVID-19; insurance policies evolve; community knowledge about LAI-PrEP grows. The tool's external configuration architecture enables parameter updates, but continuous evidence monitoring is essential to maintain validity.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Path Forward:} These limitations do not invalidate computational validation, but rather define the research roadmap. Our results establish that the algorithm itself is precise, stable, and theoretically sound across multiple scales. The critical next step is prospective validation comparing algorithmic predictions with actual patient outcomes in diverse real-world settings.

We deliberately designed the tool with an external configuration architecture specifically to enable rapid parameter refinement as implementation data accumulate. Local implementations should consider:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pilot testing with small cohorts (50--100 patients) to calibrate local parameters before full-scale deployment
\item Systematic outcome tracking to validate and refine barrier prevalence estimates, intervention effect sizes, and population-specific baseline rates
\item Intervention library adaptation to match locally-available resources and culturally-appropriate strategies
\item Continuous quality improvement using actual-vs-predicted outcome comparisons to iteratively improve algorithmic precision
\item Subgroup analyses to identify populations or settings where algorithm performance deviates from expectations, enabling targeted refinements
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Interpreting Computational Validation Results:} Our 21.2M-patient computational validation establishes the ceiling of possible performance under ideal conditions: perfect parameter accuracy, full intervention availability, high implementation fidelity, and complete patient engagement. Real-world effectiveness will necessarily fall below this ceiling due to the limitations enumerated above.

However, we argue that even substantially attenuated real-world performance would represent major public health progress. If actual implementation achieves merely half the predicted improvement (e.g., +10 percentage points rather than +19.5 points), this would still prevent hundreds of thousands of bridge period attritions and tens of thousands of HIV infections globally. The tool establishes an aspirational benchmark while acknowledging that implementation science requires continuous learning, adaptation, and refinement.

\subsection{Future Directions}

Computational validation establishes algorithmic readiness for prospective testing. We have developed comprehensive implementation resources to support pilot validation efforts, detailed in Supplementary File S4 (Implementation Guide) and operationalized through a clinical decision flowchart (Supplementary File S5). These preliminary materials include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Staged validation protocols: pilot site selection (2--3 diverse settings), data collection frameworks comparing predicted versus actual outcomes, calibration analyses within population subgroups, and multi-site expansion strategies
\item Training curriculum outline: provider education on critical interpretation of algorithmic output, recognition of model assumption limitations, and documentation of clinical override decisions
\item Research priorities: methodological innovations (synergistic barrier interactions, time-to-event modeling), evidence generation (LAI-PrEP-specific trials in women and PWID, implementation trials), and implementation science (fidelity measures, sustainability models, healthcare system adaptations)
\item Quality improvement frameworks: automated feedback loops, algorithmic drift monitoring, and continuous parameter refinement as new evidence emerges
\end{itemize}
39The Clinical Decision Flowchart (Supplementary File S5) operationalizes these protocols into a 6-step systematic workflow deployable at point-of-care: (1) PrEP status assessment identifying oral PrEP patients for same-day switching (85--90\% success rate); (2) population-specific baseline success rate determination (7 populations, 10--55\% baseline range); (3) 13-item barrier assessment with quantified impacts ($\sim$10\% reduction per barrier); (4) risk stratification into four categories (low $>$70\%, moderate 50--69\%, high 30--49\%, very high $<$30\%) with category-specific intervention intensity protocols; (5) evidence-based intervention selection from a library of 21 interventions with documented effect sizes (+6\% to +20\%) and mechanism diversity scoring to prevent redundant recommendations; and (6) timeline-based implementation guidance from Day 0 (prescription visit with barrier assessment and insurance authorization) through Day 28 (target first injection). The flowchart includes special population quick paths recognizing that traditional clinic approaches fail for PWID ($<$10\% success) while harm reduction integration achieves 30--40\%, that adolescents require youth-specific navigation to increase success from $<$20\% to 35--50\%, and that oral PrEP patients represent the highest-yield intervention opportunity (85--90\% success with streamlined protocols). Clinical pearls distilled from implementation evidence emphasize: prioritizing oral PrEP transitions as the \#1 intervention, assigning navigation for any patient with 3+ barriers, submitting insurance authorization same-day (not waiting for HIV test results), and recognizing that every additional day increases attrition risk. This systematic approach aims to standardize risk assessment and evidence-based intervention selection while preserving clinical judgment in adaptation to individual patient circumstances.

These resources require refinement through actual implementation experience. Prospective validation should prioritize equity: evaluating algorithmic calibration across diverse subgroups, ensuring implementation narrows rather than widens existing disparities, and adapting interventions to cultural contexts. Success requires balancing innovation urgency with patient safety through staged deployment, systematic outcome tracking, and transparent reporting of both successes and failures.

\section{Conclusions}

This study presents the first computational validation of an HIV prevention clinical decision support tool at UNAIDS global target scale (21.2 million patients), demonstrating exceptional algorithmic precision ($\pm$0.018 percentage points), progressive convergence across four validation scales, and substantial predicted impact (4.1 million additional successful transitions, preventing approximately 100,000 HIV infections annually).

However, computational validation establishes algorithmic readiness for testing, not clinical readiness for unrestricted deployment. We have rigorously addressed five critical questions about AI suitability in healthcare:

\textbf{External validity}: Computational precision does not eliminate clinical uncertainty---synthetic validation demonstrates mathematical correctness, not real-world accuracy. Prospective validation with actual patients in diverse settings remains essential.

\textbf{Evidence quality}: Parameters synthesize evidence from $>$15,000 trial participants, but some derive from extrapolation (cancer screening, oral PrEP cascades) rather than LAI-PrEP-specific data. External configuration enables transparency about evidence strength and rapid updates as implementation data accumulate.

\textbf{Interpretability}: Transparent additive structure enables clinicians to understand calculations, but transparency alone does not guarantee appropriate use. Effective explainability should facilitate error detection---recognizing when model reasoning may not fit specific patients---not just algorithmic comprehension.

\textbf{Equity}: Population-level predictions may mask individual disparities. Coarse categories (``MSM'', ``adolescents'') aggregate substantial heterogeneity. Prospective validation must evaluate calibration within subgroups and ensure implementation narrows rather than widens existing disparities.

\textbf{Benefit-risk balance}: Predicted benefits justify pilot testing, not immediate global deployment. We recommend staged implementation: pilot validation (2--3 sites, 50--100 patients), multi-site validation (10--15 sites, 500--1,000 patients), then scaled deployment---balancing innovation urgency with patient safety.

The LAI-PrEP bridge period represents a structural implementation barrier threatening to undermine extraordinary clinical efficacy (96\% HIV prevention). Our tool synthesizes best available evidence, achieves unprecedented computational rigor, and demonstrates substantial predicted impact. These accomplishments establish that systematic, evidence-based bridge period management is algorithmically feasible and potentially transformative.

The critical next step is translating computational potential into clinical reality through rigorous prospective validation, continuous evidence monitoring, and equity-focused implementation. By acknowledging both capabilities and limitations explicitly, we aim to model responsible AI deployment in healthcare---advancing innovation while maintaining appropriate epistemic humility about what computational models can and cannot establish about real-world patient care.

\section*{THE PROBLEM}

\begin{center}
\colorbox{red!20}{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{\centering\large\bfseries
47\% of prescribed patients never receive their first injection}}
\end{center}

\section*{STEP 1: ASSESS RISK}

\subsection*{Is patient currently on oral PrEP?}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{YES} $\rightarrow$ SUCCESS RATE: 85-90\% | \textbf{ACTION: Priority for rapid transition}
\item \textbf{NO} $\rightarrow$ Continue to population assessment
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Population Category \& Baseline Success Rates}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Population} & \textbf{Success Rate} & \textbf{Risk Level} \\
\hline
MSM & 55\% & Moderate \\
Cisgender women & 45\% & Moderate-High \\
Transgender women & 50\% & Moderate \\
\textbf{Adolescents (16-24)} & \textbf{35\%} & \textbf{HIGH} \\
\textbf{PWID} & \textbf{25\%} & \textbf{VERY HIGH} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Count Barriers (check all that apply)}

Each barrier reduces success rate (multiplicative combination):

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
\item[$\square$] Transportation
\item[$\square$] Childcare
\item[$\square$] Housing unstable
\item[$\square$] Insurance delays
\item[$\square$] Medical mistrust
\item[$\square$] Privacy concerns
\item[$\square$] Legal concerns
\item[$\square$] No government ID
\end{itemize}

\section*{STEP 2: SELECT INTERVENTIONS}

\subsection*{Priority One}

\textbf{If on oral PrEP + recent HIV test ($<$7 days):}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SAME-DAY SWITCHING} (+35 points)
\item Can inject today or within 3 days
\item Eliminates bridge period entirely
\end{itemize}

\textbf{If on oral PrEP (no recent test):}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RAPID ORAL-TO-INJECTABLE TRANSITION} (+35 points)
\item Schedule HIV test + injection for same week
\item 88-90\% success vs.\ 53\% for new patients
\end{itemize}

\textbf{If PWID:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{HARM REDUCTION INTEGRATION} (+25-35 points)
\item Partner with syringe service program
\item ESSENTIAL - traditional clinic will fail
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{PRIORITY (Implement for At-Risk Patients)}

\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Intervention} & \textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Best For} \\
\hline
Patient Navigation & +12-20 pts & Adolescents, women, anyone $<$50\% \\
Peer Navigation & +15-20 pts & PWID, transgender, complex barriers \\
Accelerated Testing & +15-20 pts & All new patients \\
Transportation Support & +10-15 pts & When barrier identified \\
Childcare Support & +8-12 pts & Parents \\
Expedited Insurance & +12-15 pts & When delays expected \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{PRIORITY}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
\item Text message reminders: +10-15 points
\item Telehealth counseling: +10-15 points
\item Mobile delivery: +15-25 points (if available)
\end{itemize}

\section*{STEP 3: CALCULATE FINAL SUCCESS RATE}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start with baseline (population rate)
\item Apply barrier impact (multiplicative combination)
\item Select 3-5 evidence-based interventions addressing diverse mechanisms. \textbf{Combined effect calculation:} Algorithm applies 70\% diminishing returns factor to sum of intervention effects (reflecting overlapping mechanisms and patient saturation), then caps final success at 95\% maximum. This ceiling varies by baseline: low-baseline patients can improve more than high-baseline patients.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Success Rate Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
\item \textbf{$>$70\%}: Excellent - standard protocols OK
\item \textbf{50-69\%}: Good - navigation recommended
\item \textbf{30-49\%}: Concerning - multiple interventions needed
\item \textbf{$<$30\%}: Critical - intensive support required
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note: See Supplementary File S7 for complete mathematical formulas and two-stage model details.}

\section*{STEP 4: IMPLEMENT \& TRACK}

\textbf{What to Do (at prescription visit):}
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0em
\item[$\square$] Assign navigator (if high risk)
\item[$\square$] Order HIV test (expedited processing)
\item[$\square$] Provide transportation voucher (if needed)
\item[$\square$] Schedule injection appointment
\item[$\square$] Submit insurance authorization
\item[$\square$] Set up text reminders
\item[$\square$] Document barriers in chart
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Follow-Up Timeline:}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
\item \textbf{24 hours}: Navigator contacts patient
\item \textbf{48 hours}: Text reminder before HIV test
\item \textbf{7-14 days}: Target for first injection (oral PrEP transitions)
\item \textbf{14-28 days}: Target for first injection (new patients)
\end{itemize}

\section*{QUICK DECISION MATRIX}

\begin{center}
\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{|p{3.5cm}|p{3.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Patient Type} & \textbf{First Action} & \textbf{Expected Success} \\
\hline
Oral PrEP + recent test & Same-day inject & 90\% \\
Oral PrEP (any) & Rapid transition & 88-90\% \\
New MSM, minimal barriers & Standard + navigation & 60-70\% \\
New woman, 2-3 barriers & Navigation + support & 50-60\% \\
Adolescent, multiple barriers & Intensive navigation & 30-45\% \\
\textbf{PWID, traditional clinic} & \textbf{WILL FAIL} & \textbf{$<$10\%} \\
PWID, harm reduction & SSP + peer nav & 35-45\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section*{RED FLAGS (System Failure Likely)}

\textbf{Don't just prescribe if you see:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PWID without harm reduction partnership
\item Adolescent without navigation support
\item Multiple barriers without intervention plan
\item Insurance issues without expedited process
\end{itemize}

\textbf{These patients will NOT initiate without proactive intervention!}

\section*{KEY TAKEAWAY}

\begin{center}
\colorbox{yellow!30}{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{\centering

\section{What is Long-Acting Injectable PrEP?}

Long-acting injectable PrEP is a medication that prevents HIV infection. Instead of taking a daily pill, you get an injection every \textbf{2 months} (cabotegravir) or \textbf{6 months} (lenacapavir).

\subsection{It Works Really Well}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Over 96\% effective at preventing HIV
\item Once you start, 8 out of 10 people keep getting their injections
\item Most people prefer injections over daily pills
\end{itemize}

\section{The ``Bridge Period'' -- What You Need to Know}

\subsection{What Is It?}

The ``bridge period'' is the time \textbf{between when your doctor prescribes the injection and when you actually get your first shot}. This usually takes \textbf{2--4 weeks}, but can be shorter if you're already on PrEP pills.

\subsection{Why Can't I Start Today?}

Unlike PrEP pills (which you can start the same day), the injection lasts for months in your body. We need to make absolutely sure you don't have HIV before giving you the injection. This requires:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item $\checkmark$ An HIV test
\item $\checkmark$ Waiting for results
\item $\checkmark$ Insurance approval (if needed)
\item $\checkmark$ Scheduling your injection appointment
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black,title=Important]
During this waiting period, you are \textbf{not protected} from HIV yet. If you're at risk, talk to your doctor about using daily PrEP pills while you wait, or other prevention methods.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{What Happens Next? Your Timeline}

\subsection{TODAY (Prescription Visit)}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item Your doctor orders an HIV test
\item Your doctor submits insurance approval (if needed)
\item You schedule your HIV test appointment
\item You might be assigned a ``navigator'' to help you through the process
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Within 1--2 Days}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item You get your HIV test (blood draw or rapid test)
\item A navigator (if assigned) will call you to check in
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Within 3--7 Days}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item Your HIV test results come back
\item Your doctor reviews results with you
\item Your injection appointment is confirmed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Within 2--4 Weeks (Goal)}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{You get your first injection!}
\item You schedule your next injection (2 or 6 months away)
\end{itemize}

\section{How We'll Stay in Touch}

You'll receive:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Text messages} reminding you about appointments
\item \textbf{Phone calls} from your navigator or clinic
\item \textbf{Email} (if you prefer)
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Important]
Please respond to texts and calls! We want to make sure you successfully get started.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{What If I Need Help?}

\subsection{Transportation}

\textbf{Problem:} ``I don't have a way to get to my appointments.''

\textbf{Solution:} Tell your navigator or clinic! Many programs can provide:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Uber/Lyft vouchers
\item Public transit passes
\item Mileage reimbursement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Childcare}

\textbf{Problem:} ``I can't leave my kids to go to appointments.''

\textbf{Solution:} Ask about:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item On-site childcare at the clinic
\item Childcare vouchers
\item Home-based services
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schedule Conflicts}

\textbf{Problem:} ``I work during clinic hours.''

\textbf{Solution:} Many clinics offer:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Early morning or evening appointments
\item Weekend hours
\item Flexible scheduling
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Privacy Concerns}

\textbf{Problem:} ``I don't want my family to know I'm taking PrEP.''

\textbf{Solution:} Tell your doctor! They can:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use confidential communication methods
\item Help manage insurance statements
\item Protect your privacy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Insurance Issues}

\textbf{Problem:} ``My insurance denied the medication.''

\textbf{Solution:} Your clinic can:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Appeal the denial
\item Help with patient assistance programs
\item Find alternative payment options
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Barriers}

Whatever barrier you're facing, \textbf{please tell your navigator or doctor}. They want to help you succeed!

\section{Red Flags -- When to Call}

Call your clinic if:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item $\times$ You haven't heard from anyone within 3 days of your prescription
\item $\times$ Your HIV test wasn't scheduled
\item $\times$ It's been over a week and you don't have test results
\item $\times$ Your insurance denied coverage and no one has called you
\item $\times$ You can't make your scheduled appointments
\item $\times$ You have questions or concerns
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black,title=Don't Wait!]
The sooner you call, the sooner we can fix the problem!
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Frequently Asked Questions}

\subsection{``Why is this taking so long?''}

We know it's frustrating to wait. The injection lasts for months, so we must be 100\% certain you don't have HIV. This is for your safety.

\subsection{``Can I start PrEP pills while I wait?''}

\textbf{YES!} Ask your doctor. Many people take daily PrEP pills during the bridge period to stay protected, then switch to the injection when ready.

\subsection{``What if I miss an appointment?''}

\textbf{Call us immediately!} We can reschedule. Missing one appointment doesn't mean you can't get the injection -- we just need to get you back on track.

\subsection{``Will the injection hurt?''}

Most people describe it as similar to a flu shot. The injection site might be sore for a few days. Your doctor will tell you how to manage any discomfort.

\subsection{``What happens after my first injection?''}

You'll schedule your next injection (2 or 6 months away). After the first injection, it gets much easier -- you just show up for your scheduled appointments!

\subsection{``What if I change my mind?''}

That's okay! You can stop at any time. Just let your doctor know. If you're not sure, talk to your navigator -- they can address your concerns.

\section{Tips for Success}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\checkmark$}{Checkmark} Respond to texts and calls}

Even a quick ``yes'' or ``got it'' helps us know you're still on track.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\checkmark$}{Checkmark} Ask for help early}

Don't wait until the day of your appointment to figure out transportation or childcare.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\checkmark$}{Checkmark} Keep your appointments}

Every appointment gets you closer to starting. If you can't make it, call to reschedule right away.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\checkmark$}{Checkmark} Be honest about barriers}

We can't help if we don't know what challenges you're facing.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\checkmark$}{Checkmark} Stay motivated}

Remember why you wanted the injection! Once you get started, you won't have to think about daily pills anymore.

\section{Your Team}

You're not alone in this process. Your team includes:

\subsection{Your Doctor/Nurse Practitioner}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Prescribed the injection
\item Reviews your HIV tests
\item Administers your injections

\section{Why This Matters}

HIV prevention is serious healthcare. Research shows that almost \textbf{half of people who are prescribed this injection never get their first shot}. Not because the medication doesn't work -- it works great! But because of the challenges in the weeks between prescription and injection.

\textbf{That's why we're putting in this extra effort to help you succeed.}

The injection is highly effective and convenient once you start. We just need to get you through these first few weeks. With your participation and our support, you WILL get there!

\section{Quick Checklist -- Keep This Handy}

\subsection{Before your first injection, you need:}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item HIV test completed
\item Results reviewed (must be negative)
\item Insurance approved (or payment arranged)
\item Injection appointment scheduled
\item Transportation arranged
\item Childcare arranged (if needed)
\item Questions answered
\end{itemize}

\subsection{When you're ready:}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item Show up for your appointment
\item Get your injection
\item Schedule next appointment
\item Done! Much easier from here on!
\end{itemize}

\section{Remember}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{96\% effective} once you start
\item \textbf{4--6 appointments per year} (vs.\ 365 daily pills)
\item \textbf{Most people prefer} injections over pills
\item \textbf{Your navigator is here to help} -- use them!
\item \textbf{Thousands of people} have successfully started -- you can too!
\end{itemize}

\section{After Your First Injection}

Once you get your first injection, the hard part is over! You'll come back in \textbf{2 months} (cabotegravir) or \textbf{6 months} (lenacapavir) for your next shot. No daily pills to remember. No monthly pharmacy visits.

      "MOBILE_DELIVERY"
    ],
    "primary_population": "PWID"
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Risk Category Configuration}

Risk stratification guides intensity of intervention recommendations:

\begin{verbatim}[language=json,caption={Risk category excerpt}]
"risk_categories": {
  "LOW_RISK": {
    "threshold_lower": 0.70,
    "threshold_upper": 1.00,

    "intervention_intensity": "minimal"
  },
  "MODERATE_RISK": {
    "threshold_lower": 0.40,
    "threshold_upper": 0.69,
    "recommendation": "Enhanced support; 1-2 targeted interventions",
    "intervention_intensity": "moderate"
  },
  "HIGH_RISK": {
    "threshold_lower": 0.00,
    "threshold_upper": 0.39,
    "recommendation": "Intensive navigation; 3-4 multi-level interventions",
    "intervention_intensity": "intensive"
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Algorithm Parameters}

Technical parameters control calculation methods (configuration v3.1.0):

\begin{verbatim}[language=json,caption={Algorithm parameters excerpt (v3.1.0)}]
"algorithm_parameters": {
  "max_attrition_ceiling": 0.95,
  "intervention_diminishing_returns_factor": 0.70,
  "max_success_rate_with_interventions": 0.95,
  "minimum_bridge_duration_days": 2,
  "maximum_bridge_duration_days": 56,
  "best_case_success_floor": 0.85,
  "bridge_duration_oral_prep_recent_test": [0, 3],
  "bridge_duration_oral_prep_no_recent_test": [7, 14],
  "bridge_duration_naive_recent_test": [14, 35],
  "bridge_duration_naive_no_recent_test": [21, 56],
  "barrier_count_adjustment_factor": {
    "0_barriers": 0.00,
    "1_barrier": 0.05,
    "2_barriers": 0.08,
    "3_plus_barriers": 0.10
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Key Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{intervention\_diminishing\_returns\_factor: 0.70} - Combined intervention effects calculated as 70\% of sum (Stage 1 of two-stage model)
\item \texttt{max\_success\_rate\_with\_interventions: 0.95} - Absolute success ceiling at 95\% (Stage 2 of two-stage model)
\item \texttt{best\_case\_success\_floor: 0.85} - Minimum success rate for optimal scenarios (oral PrEP patients with no barriers)
\item Bridge duration ranges vary by PrEP status and HIV test recency
\item Barrier impacts combine multiplicatively: $P_{attrition} = 1 - \prod(1 - b_j)$
\end{itemize}

See Supplementary File S7 for complete mathematical formulas and detailed explanation of the two-stage success rate model.

\section{Configuration Usage}

\subsection{Loading the Configuration}

The tool loads the configuration at runtime using Python's JSON parser:

\begin{verbatim}[language=json,caption={Python usage example (pseudocode)}]
import json

# Load configuration
with open('lai_prep_config.json', 'r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

# Access population data
msm_baseline = config['populations']['MSM']['baseline_attrition']
msm_interventions = config['populations']['MSM']['priority_interventions']

# Access barrier data
transport_impact = config['barriers']['TRANSPORTATION']['impact']

# Access intervention data
nav_improvement = config['interventions']['PATIENT_NAVIGATION']['improvement']
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Institutional Adaptation}

Institutions can modify the configuration to reflect local contexts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Update baseline rates}: Adjust population-specific attrition rates based on local data
\item \textbf{Modify barrier impacts}: Calibrate barrier impacts to local prevalence
\item \textbf{Add/remove interventions}: Include locally-available interventions or disable unavailable ones
\item \textbf{Adjust effect sizes}: Update intervention effects based on local implementation outcomes
\item \textbf{Set resource constraints}: Configure available interventions by healthcare setting
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Version Control}

Each configuration file includes version information for reproducibility:

\begin{verbatim}[language=json,caption={Version metadata}]
{
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "last_updated": "2025-10-17",
  "description": "Configuration file for LAI-PrEP Bridge Period Decision Support Tool"
}
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Current Version:} v3.1.0 (October 17, 2025)

\textbf{Major Changes from v2.0.0:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Replaced \texttt{max\_cumulative\_intervention\_effect} with two-stage success rate model
\item Added \texttt{intervention\_diminishing\_returns\_factor: 0.70} (Stage 1)
\item Added \texttt{max\_success\_rate\_with\_interventions: 0.95} (Stage 2 ceiling)
\item Added \texttt{best\_case\_success\_floor: 0.85}
\item Expanded bridge duration parameters for different PrEP/testing scenarios
\item Added barrier count adjustment factors (0, 1, 2, 3+ barriers)
\item Updated SAME\_DAY\_SWITCHING effect size: 0.25 $\rightarrow$ 0.35
\item Changed barrier combination description to explicitly state multiplicative model
\end{itemize}

\section{Evidence Integration}

All parameters are derived from peer-reviewed literature:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Baseline attrition rates}: HPTN 083, HPTN 084, PURPOSE trials, real-world cohort studies
\item \textbf{Barrier impacts}: PrEP cascade literature, implementation science studies
\item \textbf{Intervention effects}: Randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses
\item \textbf{Population differences}: Clinical trial subgroup analyses, epidemiological data
\end{itemize}

\section{Patient Input Examples}

For reproducibility and tool testing, we provide example patient profiles representing diverse clinical scenarios.

\subsection{Single Patient JSON Example}

Individual patient assessments use JSON format with the following structure:

\begin{verbatim}[language=json,caption={Example patient input (example\_patient.json)}]
{
  "patient_id": "example_001",
  "population": "PWID",
  "age": 35,
  "current_prep_status": "naive",
  "barriers": [
    "HOUSING_INSTABILITY",
    "TRANSPORTATION",
    "LEGAL_CONCERNS"
  ],
  "healthcare_setting": "HARM_REDUCTION",
  "insurance_status": "uninsured",
  "recent_hiv_test": false,
  "transportation_access": false,
  "childcare_needs": false
}
\end{verbatim}

This example represents a person who injects drugs (PWID) with multiple structural barriers - a high-risk scenario requiring intensive navigation support.

\subsection{Batch Processing CSV Example}

For research or quality improvement projects analyzing multiple patients, CSV format enables efficient batch processing:

\begin{verbatim}[language=json,caption={Example batch input format (example\_patients.csv)},basicstyle=\scriptsize\ttfamily]
patient_id,population,age,current_prep_status,barriers,setting,...
patient_001,MSM,28,oral_prep,SCHEDULING_CONFLICTS,LGBTQ_CENTER,...
patient_002,CISGENDER_WOMEN,32,naive,"TRANSPORTATION,CHILDCARE",...
patient_003,PWID,35,naive,"HOUSING_INSTABILITY,LEGAL_CONCERNS",...
patient_004,ADOLESCENT,17,naive,"PRIVACY_CONCERNS",...
patient_005,TRANSGENDER_WOMEN,26,discontinued_oral,DISCRIMINATION,...
\end{verbatim}

The complete example file contains 10 diverse patients spanning all populations and barrier combinations.

\subsection{Clinical Scenarios Represented}

Example patients cover the full spectrum of bridge period challenges:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Low-barrier case}: MSM on oral PrEP, insured, same-day switching candidate
\item \textbf{Moderate-barrier case}: Cisgender woman, transportation + childcare needs
\item \textbf{High-barrier case}: PWID, housing instability + multiple barriers
\item \textbf{Special populations}: Adolescents (privacy), pregnant/lactating (competing priorities)
\item \textbf{Healthcare settings}: LGBTQ centers, harm reduction programs, community clinics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage Examples}

These files enable immediate tool testing:

\begin{verbatim}[language=json,caption={Command-line usage}]
# Assess single patient
python cli.py assess -i example_patient.json -o results.json

# Batch process multiple patients
python cli.py batch -i example_patients.csv -o batch_results.json

# Validate configuration
python cli.py validate -c lai_prep_config.json
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Purpose of This Guide}

This implementation guide provides preliminary protocols and recommendations for prospective validation of the LAI-PrEP Bridge Period Decision Support Tool. \textbf{Important caveats:}

\begin{itemize}
\item These materials are \textbf{preliminary} and require refinement through actual implementation experience
\item Computational validation establishes algorithmic precision, not clinical readiness for unrestricted deployment
\item All recommendations should be adapted to local context, resources, and patient populations
\item Prospective validation with real patient outcomes is essential before widespread adoption
\item Implementation teams should document both successes and failures to enable continuous learning
\end{itemize}

\section{Staged Implementation Pathway}

Based on our computational validation findings and critical assessment of AI suitability, we propose a structured implementation pathway balancing innovation urgency with patient safety.

\subsection{Phase 1: Immediate Actions (0--6 months)}

\subsubsection{Pilot Site Selection}

Identify \textbf{2--3 diverse clinical settings} representing populations with different baseline success rates and barrier profiles:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Suggested site types:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Urban academic center serving men who have sex with men (MSM) --- typically highest baseline success rates but potential insurance/authorization barriers
\item Community clinic serving cisgender women in high-prevalence area --- moderate baseline rates with transportation, childcare, and structural barriers
\item Harm reduction program serving people who inject drugs (PWID) --- lowest baseline rates with substance use, stigma, and housing instability barriers
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Site selection criteria:}
\begin{itemize}
\item LAI-PrEP prescribing volume: minimum 20--30 patients/year anticipated
\item Institutional commitment to systematic outcome tracking
\item Availability of patient navigation or case management resources
\item Diverse patient population for subgroup analyses
\item Electronic health record capabilities for data collection
\item Research infrastructure or quality improvement expertise
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Sample size considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Target 50--100 patients per site over 6--12 months
\item Minimum 150 total patients across all pilot sites for adequate statistical power
\item Oversample populations with lower baseline success rates (women, PWID, adolescents) to enable equity analyses
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Institutional Review and Adaptation}

Local implementation teams should critically review the external configuration file (\texttt{lai\_prep\_config.json}):

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Barrier prevalence assessment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Do local barrier prevalence rates match national estimates in the configuration?
\item Example: If local MSM population has 15\% insurance barriers (vs.\ 28\% national), adjust \texttt{insurance\_auth\_barrier\_rate}
\item Document all parameter modifications with justification
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Intervention availability audit:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Which of the 21 interventions are actually available locally?
\item Example: If expedited HIV testing not available, set \texttt{effect\_size} to 0 for that intervention
\item Identify locally-available interventions not in the library (candidates for addition)
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Effect size calibration:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Are national effect size estimates appropriate for local context?
\item Example: Patient navigation may have different effectiveness in rural vs.\ urban settings
\item Consider local pilot data if available; otherwise use default values initially
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Population-specific baseline rates:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Review baseline bridge period success rates for each population
\item Adjust if local data suggest different rates (e.g., high-performing clinic with strong navigation infrastructure)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Clinician Training}

Train providers to use the tool appropriately while maintaining clinical judgment:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Core competencies:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Interpret algorithmic output: understand risk scores, barrier profiles, intervention recommendations
\item Recognize model limitations: identify when model assumptions may not fit specific patients
\item Exercise clinical override: document decisions when clinical judgment differs from algorithm
\item Provide patient-centered care: use recommendations as decision support, not replacement for human judgment
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Training curriculum (suggested 2--3 hour session):}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Module 1 (30 min):} LAI-PrEP bridge period attrition crisis and evidence base
\item \textit{Module 2 (45 min):} Tool architecture, intervention library, mechanism diversity scoring
\item \textit{Module 3 (45 min):} Clinical case scenarios with tool output interpretation
\item \textit{Module 4 (30 min):} Documentation requirements, override protocols, feedback mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Ongoing support:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Weekly case conferences reviewing challenging patients
\item Monthly calibration meetings comparing predicted vs.\ actual outcomes
\item Access to implementation science team for technical questions
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Data Collection Protocols}

Establish systematic outcome tracking infrastructure:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Required data elements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Patient demographics: age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic indicators
\item Population category: MSM, cisgender women, PWID, adolescents (may overlap)
\item Baseline assessment: date of LAI-PrEP prescription, identified barriers, risk factors
\item Algorithmic output: predicted success probability, recommended interventions, mechanism diversity score
\item Interventions delivered: which recommendations implemented, fidelity assessment, timing
\item Primary outcome: bridge period success (received first injection within 60 days) vs.\ attrition
\item Secondary outcomes: time to first injection, barriers encountered, reasons for attrition
\item Clinical overrides: instances where provider deviated from recommendations with justification
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Data quality assurance:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Real-time data entry with validation rules
\item Monthly audits for completeness and accuracy
\item Standardized definitions for barriers and interventions
\item Regular calibration across sites to ensure consistent measurement
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Ethical considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Institutional review board approval for research (if applicable)
\item Quality improvement exemption (if applicable)
\item Patient consent for data use
\item Data privacy and security protocols (HIPAA compliance)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Phase 2: Pilot Validation (6--12 months)}

Conduct rigorous evaluation of algorithm performance with real patients:

\subsubsection{Outcome Analysis}

Collect and analyze \textbf{150--300 patient outcomes} across pilot sites:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Calibration assessment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Overall calibration:} Do predicted success rates match actual rates?
\item \textit{Subgroup calibration:} Evaluate separately for MSM, women, PWID, adolescents
\item \textit{Risk stratification:} Compare outcomes across predicted risk quartiles
\item \textit{Statistical tests:} Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit, calibration plots
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Discrimination evaluation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the tool effectively separate high-risk from low-risk patients?
\item Calculate area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
\item Assess sensitivity and specificity at different risk thresholds
\item Evaluate positive and negative predictive values
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Intervention effectiveness:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Do recommended interventions achieve predicted improvements?
\item Compare outcomes: interventions received vs.\ not received
\item Assess dose-response: more interventions → better outcomes?
\item Evaluate mechanism diversity: Do diverse mechanisms improve outcomes beyond number of interventions?
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Failure mode identification:}
\begin{itemize}
\item What patient characteristics result in inaccurate predictions?
\item Identify barriers not adequately captured in the model
\item Document intervention implementation challenges
\item Analyze clinical override patterns (when and why providers deviated)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Equity Analysis}

Evaluate algorithmic fairness across populations:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Differential calibration:} Does accuracy vary by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status?
\item \textbf{Differential benefit:} Do interventions work equally well across subgroups?
\item \textbf{Access equity:} Are recommended interventions equally available to all populations?
\item \textbf{Outcome disparities:} Does tool use narrow or widen existing gaps in bridge period success?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Parameter Refinement}

Based on pilot data, update configuration parameters:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Revise barrier prevalence estimates where local rates differ from national
\item Adjust intervention effect sizes based on observed outcomes
\item Update population-specific baseline rates if needed
\item Add new barriers or interventions identified during pilot
\item Modify mechanism diversity scoring if redundancies observed
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Phase 3: Multi-Site Expansion (12--24 months)}

Scale to broader geographic and demographic diversity:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Site expansion:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Expand to \textbf{10--15 sites} representing diverse geographies, healthcare systems, and patient populations
\item Include mix of academic medical centers, community health centers, harm reduction programs, and telehealth providers
\item Target sites in high-HIV-burden regions (Southern U.S., urban epicenters, rural areas)
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Sample size goals:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Collect \textbf{500--1,000 patient outcomes} across all sites
\item Ensure adequate representation: minimum 100 patients each for MSM, women, PWID, adolescents
\item Oversample underrepresented populations for subgroup analyses
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Equity analyses:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comprehensive calibration evaluation across race, ethnicity, gender, age, socioeconomic status
\item Assess intervention access and effectiveness disparities
\item Document health system adaptations needed to ensure equitable care
\item Identify populations or settings where algorithm performs poorly
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Dissemination:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Publish validation results in peer-reviewed implementation science journal
\item Present findings at scientific conferences (CROI, IAS, USCA)
\item Release updated configuration files with refined parameters
\item Develop implementation toolkit for other sites
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Phase 4: Continuous Quality Improvement (24+ months)}

Establish sustainable infrastructure for ongoing monitoring and refinement:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Automated feedback loops:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Real-time comparison of predicted vs.\ actual outcomes
\item Dashboards displaying calibration metrics over time
\item Alert systems flagging performance degradation
\item Regular reports to clinical teams and administrators
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Algorithmic drift monitoring:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Track changes in calibration and discrimination over time
\item Identify when recalibration or retraining needed
\item Distinguish true drift (changing populations) from data quality issues
\item Implement version control for configuration updates
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Evidence updates:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Monitor emerging LAI-PrEP implementation literature
\item Incorporate new trial results (HPTN 102, HPTN 103, PURPOSE extensions)

\item Conduct validation studies in low- and middle-income countries
\item Address context-specific barriers (e.g., patent medicine vendors in West Africa)
\item Ensure cultural appropriateness of interventions
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Priorities}

Advancing both the science and practice of bridge period management requires coordinated research across multiple domains:

\subsection{Methodological Innovations}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]

\item Structural violence and bridge period outcomes
\item Policy interventions addressing root causes of disparities
\item Community-level interventions beyond individual patient support
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation Science}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Fidelity measurement:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop validated scales assessing intervention implementation quality

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Policy research:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Insurance authorization streamlining
\item Expedited HIV testing protocols
\item Pharmacy dispensing models
\item Same-day initiation feasibility
\item Task-shifting to nurses, pharmacists, community health workers
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Quality Assurance Framework}

\subsection{Performance Monitoring Metrics}

Sites should track the following metrics monthly:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Outcome metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bridge period success rate (overall and by population)
\item Time from prescription to first injection (median, IQR)
\item Attrition rate and reasons for attrition
\item 6-month and 12-month persistence on LAI-PrEP
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Algorithmic performance:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Calibration: predicted vs.\ actual success rates
\item Discrimination: AUROC for risk stratification
\item Subgroup performance: calibration within populations
\item Override rate: frequency of clinical judgment overriding recommendations
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Process metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Intervention delivery rate: \% of recommended interventions actually provided
\item Intervention timeliness: lag between recommendation and delivery
\item Documentation completeness: \% of required data fields captured
\item Patient engagement: \% accepting navigation services
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Equity metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Outcome disparities by race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status
\item Intervention access disparities
\item Calibration equity across subgroups
\item Representation: demographics of patients served vs.\ indicated population
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Corrective Action Triggers}

Establish thresholds for initiating corrective actions:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Poor overall calibration:} Predicted-observed difference $>$5 percentage points for 2 consecutive months → Parameter review and recalibration

\item \textbf{Subgroup calibration failure:} Any population with predicted-observed difference $>$10 points → Targeted parameter adjustment for that population

\item \textbf{Declining performance:} Bridge period success rate declining $>$5 points over 3 months → Process evaluation and intervention reinforcement

\item \textbf{Low intervention delivery:} $<$50\% of recommended interventions provided → Workflow redesign and barrier assessment

\item \textbf{Widening disparities:} Outcome gap between populations increasing $>$5 points → Equity-focused intervention
\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations and Cautions}

Implementation teams should recognize these important limitations:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Parameter uncertainty:} Many parameters extrapolated from non-LAI-PrEP populations; prospective validation essential

\item \textbf{Local variation:} National estimates may not match local context; adaptation required

\item \textbf{Implementation challenges:} Recommended interventions require resources, training, and organizational commitment

\item \textbf{Patient heterogeneity:} Population-level predictions may not apply to individual patients; clinical judgment essential

\item \textbf{Unmeasured barriers:} Model cannot account for barriers not explicitly measured

\item \textbf{Causal assumptions:} Intervention effects assumed causal; confounding possible in observational validation

\item \textbf{Generalizability:} Validation in U.S. settings may not generalize to international contexts

\item \textbf{Evolving evidence:} LAI-PrEP implementation science rapidly evolving; continuous updates required
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

This implementation guide provides preliminary protocols for prospective validation of the LAI-PrEP Bridge Period Decision Support Tool. Successful implementation requires:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Staged deployment} balancing innovation with safety
\item \textbf{Systematic outcome tracking} enabling evidence-based refinement
\item \textbf{Equity focus} ensuring benefits reach populations with greatest barriers
\item \textbf{Continuous learning} from both successes and failures
\item \textbf{Transparent reporting} building the evidence base for decision support in HIV prevention
\end{itemize}

These materials should be adapted to local context and refined based on implementation experience. The ultimate goal is translating computational validation into real-world impact: preventing HIV infections by systematically addressing the bridge period attrition crisis.

\section*{Purpose of This Flowchart}

This clinical decision flowchart provides systematic guidance for LAI-PrEP bridge period management at the point of prescription. It translates the evidence-based decision support algorithm into actionable clinical workflows, enabling clinicians to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rapidly identify patients for same-day switching protocols
\item Assess population-specific risks and barriers
\item Stratify patients by predicted success rate
\item Select appropriate evidence-based interventions
\item Implement structured follow-up protocols
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Critical Insight}: Without systematic intervention, 47\% of LAI-PrEP prescriptions do not result in injection initiation. This flowchart addresses that implementation gap.

\section{Step 1: Oral PrEP Status Assessment}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{INITIAL TRIAGE QUESTION},breakable]
\textbf{Is the patient currently taking oral PrEP?}

This is the single most important clinical decision point that determines bridge period pathway.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{YES: Patient on Oral PrEP → Expedited Pathway}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10!white,colframe=green!75!black,title=\textbf{Secondary Question: Recent HIV Test?},breakable]

\subsubsection{If YES (HIV test within 7 days):}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!20!white,colframe=green!75!black,title=* PRIORITY 1: Same-Day Switching Protocol]
\textbf{Predicted Success: 90\%} \\
\textbf{Bridge Period: 0--3 days}

\textbf{Actions at Prescription Visit:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item $\checkmark$ Inject TODAY (preferred) or within 3 days maximum
\item $\checkmark$ Submit insurance authorization same day
\item $\checkmark$ Document switch in medical record
\item $\checkmark$ Schedule next injection (2 or 6 months)
\item $\checkmark$ Provide injection site care instructions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Evidence}: OPERA cohort (n=302), Trio Health (n=146) demonstrated 85--90\% success with same-day protocols.

\textbf{Key Point}: Do NOT make these patients wait. They are already engaged and adherent.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{If NO (HIV test >7 days ago or never):}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!15!white,colframe=green!75!black, title=* PRIORITY 2: Rapid Transition Protocol, breakable]
\textbf{Predicted Success: 85--90\%} \\
\textbf{Bridge Period: 7--14 days}

\textbf{Actions at Prescription Visit:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item $\checkmark$ Order STAT HIV testing (same day if possible)
\item $\checkmark$ Submit insurance authorization TODAY (do not wait for test)
\item $\checkmark$ Schedule injection for next week (tentative)
\item $\checkmark$ Confirm injection once negative test result received
\item $\checkmark$ Continue oral PrEP until injection
\item $\checkmark$ Set text reminders for test and injection appointments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Goal}: Minimize wait time to preserve oral PrEP adherence momentum.
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{NO: Patient NOT on Oral PrEP → Standard Pathway}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!10!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
Proceed to \textbf{STEP 2: Population \& Barrier Assessment}

This pathway requires systematic risk assessment and intervention planning.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Step 2: Population \& Barrier Assessment}

\subsection{Population Identification}

Identify patient's primary population (baseline success rate without barriers):

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Population} & \textbf{Baseline Success} & \textbf{Evidence Source} \\
\hline
MSM & 55\% & HPTN 083 \\
Cisgender Women & 45\% & HPTN 084, PURPOSE-1 \\
Transgender Women & 50\% & HPTN 083, PURPOSE-2 \\
Adolescents (16--24) & 35\% & PURPOSE-1, oral PrEP \\
PWID & 25\% & Oral PrEP cascade \\
Pregnant/Lactating & 45\% & PURPOSE-1 \\
General Population & 53\% & Real-world cohorts \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Barrier Assessment Checklist}

Check ALL barriers that apply. Each barrier reduces success rate by approximately 10 percentage points:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!10!white,colframe=yellow!75!black,breakable]
\textbf{Structural Barriers:}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item Transportation barriers (no reliable access to clinic)
\item Childcare needs (cannot attend appointments without childcare)
\item Housing instability (homeless or unstable housing)
\item Insurance delays expected (prior authorization typically >2 weeks)
\item Scheduling conflicts (work/school during clinic hours)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interpersonal \& Systemic Barriers:}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item Medical mistrust (history of negative healthcare experiences)
\item Privacy concerns (disclosure fears, confidentiality needs)
\item Healthcare discrimination (experienced/anticipated discrimination)
\item Competing priorities (other urgent health/life needs)
\item Limited healthcare navigation experience (new to system)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Population-Specific Barriers:}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item Legal/criminalization concerns (PWID, sex work, immigration)
\item Lack of government identification
\item Active substance use (interfering with appointment attendance)
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Calculate Adjusted Success Rate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{Calculation Formula}]
\textbf{Adjusted Success Rate = Baseline Rate -- (10\% × Number of Barriers)}

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item MSM (55\%) with 1 barrier (transportation) = 45\% success
\item Cisgender woman (45\%) with 3 barriers (transport, childcare, mistrust) = 15\% success
\item PWID (25\%) with 4 barriers = Cannot go below 0\% (use 5--10\% estimate)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note}: This is a simplified clinical calculation. The full algorithm uses multiplicative probability adjustments for greater precision.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Step 3: Risk Categorization \& Intervention Selection}

Based on adjusted success rate, categorize patient and select interventions:

\subsection{Low Risk: Adjusted Success >70\%}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10!white,colframe=green!75!black,breakable]
\textbf{Risk Level}: Low \\
\textbf{Predicted Success}: 70--85\%

\textbf{Standard Protocols:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Text/email reminders for appointments
\item Expedited HIV testing (within 3--5 days)
\item Standard insurance authorization process
\item Patient education materials
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Follow-up}: Brief check-in call 1 week post-prescription
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Moderate Risk: Adjusted Success 50--69\%}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!15!white,colframe=yellow!75!black,breakable]
\textbf{Risk Level}: Moderate \\
\textbf{Predicted Success}: 60--75\% (with interventions)

\textbf{Enhanced Protocols:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Assign patient navigator} (2--3 contacts during bridge period)
\item Text/email/phone reminders
\item Expedited/same-day HIV testing
\item Address 1--2 key barriers with targeted interventions
\item Insurance support (tracking, appeals if needed)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Barrier-Specific Interventions:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Transportation → Uber/Lyft vouchers, mileage reimbursement
\item Scheduling → Extended hours, weekend appointments
\item Insurance → Pre-authorization assistance, patient assistance programs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Follow-up}: Navigator contact within 24--48 hours, then weekly
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{High Risk: Adjusted Success 30--49\%}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!15!white,colframe=orange!75!black,breakable]
\textbf{Risk Level}: High \\
\textbf{Predicted Success}: 40--60\% (with intensive interventions)

\textbf{Intensive Interventions Required:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Navigator assignment} (MANDATORY -- minimum 3 contacts)
\item Accelerated HIV testing (same-day rapid test if possible)
\item Transportation support (vouchers, rides, mileage)
\item Barrier-specific intensive support:
\begin{itemize}
\item Childcare vouchers or on-site childcare
\item Flexible scheduling (early/late/weekend)
\item Insurance advocacy and appeals
\item Peer navigation (if available)
\end{itemize}
\item Close follow-up (every 2--3 days)
\item Case conference if barriers persist
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multiple Intervention Modalities}: Combine structural support (transportation, childcare) with interpersonal support (navigation, peer support)
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Very High Risk: Adjusted Success <30\%}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!15!white,colframe=red!75!black,breakable]
\textbf{Risk Level}: Very High \\
\textbf{Predicted Success}: 20--40\% (with maximum interventions)

\textbf{Maximum Intensity Interventions:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Intensive navigation} (multiple contacts weekly)
\item \textbf{Peer navigator} (if available, especially for PWID, transgender populations)
\item \textbf{Harm reduction integration} (for PWID)
\item \textbf{Mobile/outreach services} (bring services to patient)
\item \textbf{Low-barrier protocols}:
\begin{itemize}
\item No ID requirement
\item Flexible scheduling
\item Home visits if needed
\item Telehealth options
\end{itemize}
\item Address ALL identified barriers simultaneously
\item Daily contact first week, then every 2--3 days
\item Case management beyond bridge period
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Critical}: These patients require healthcare system-level support, not just individual interventions. Consider alternative care delivery models.

\section{Step 5: Special Population Protocols}

\subsection{PWID Fast Track}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!10!white,colframe=red!75!black,title=\textbf{People Who Inject Drugs: Alternative Care Model Required},breakable]
\textbf{Critical Insight}: Traditional clinic-based care results in <10\% success for PWID. An alternative approach is essential.

\textbf{Required Elements:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{MUST} partner with syringe services program (SSP) or harm reduction program
\item Bring ALL services to the patient (co-locate at SSP site)
\item Use peer navigators with lived experience
\item Low-barrier protocols:
\begin{itemize}
\item No government ID required
\item No abstinence requirements
\item Flexible appointment times
\item No-show tolerant (immediate rescheduling)
\end{itemize}
\item Rapid HIV testing at SSP site (same-day results)
\item Mobile delivery if SSP partnership unavailable
\item Integrate with medication-assisted treatment (MAT)
\item Address housing and food insecurity simultaneously
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Outcome}: 30--40\% success (compared to <10\% in traditional clinic)

\textbf{Evidence}: Harm reduction PrEP literature, oral PrEP PWID cascade studies
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Adolescent Fast Track}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!10!white,colframe=orange!75!black,title=\textbf{Adolescents (16--24): Youth-Specific Approach},breakable]
\textbf{Key Barriers}: Transportation dependence, privacy concerns, limited healthcare navigation experience

\textbf{Required Elements:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Youth-specific navigator (ESSENTIAL -- trained in adolescent development)
\item Transportation without parental involvement (vouchers, youth-friendly transit)
\item Confidential scheduling and communication
\item School-friendly appointment times (after school, early morning, weekends)
\item Bundle appointments (test + inject same day when possible)
\item Text-based communication (preferred by adolescents)
\item Privacy protections (manage insurance EOBs, parental notifications)
\item Brief, focused visits (adolescent attention span)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Outcome}: 35--50\% success with navigation (vs. <20\% without)

\textbf{Evidence}: PURPOSE-1 adolescent cohort, oral PrEP adolescent cascade
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Oral PrEP Patients: Your Easiest Win}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10!white,colframe=green!75!black,title=\textbf{Current Oral PrEP Users: Highest Success Opportunity},breakable]
\textbf{Critical Message}: These are your highest-success patients. Do NOT let them fall through cracks.

\textbf{Streamlined Protocol:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Recent HIV test (within 7 days)? → INJECT TODAY
\item No recent test? → Order test, inject within 7 days maximum
\item Same-day insurance authorization (do not delay)
\item Minimal wait time (preserve adherence momentum)
\item Build on existing provider relationship
\item Continue oral PrEP until injection (if needed)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Outcome}: 85--90\% success

\textbf{Key Point}: Every day of delay increases risk of oral PrEP discontinuation and loss to follow-up.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Step 6: Implementation \& Follow-Up Timeline}

\subsection{Day 0: Prescription Visit}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,breakable]
\textbf{Essential Actions at Prescription:}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item Complete barrier assessment (use checklist in Step 2)
\item Calculate adjusted success rate and risk category
\item Select interventions based on this flowchart
\item Order HIV testing (expedited/STAT)
\item Submit insurance authorization SAME DAY (critical!)
\item Assign patient navigator if moderate to very high risk
\item Provide transportation voucher if barrier identified
\item Schedule tentative injection appointment
\item Set up text/email reminders
\item Give patient clear timeline and expectations
\item Provide patient handout (Supplementary File S2)
\item Document barriers and intervention plan in medical record
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Time Investment}: 15--20 minutes for comprehensive assessment
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Day 1: Next Business Day}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black]
\textbf{Navigator Actions:}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item Contact patient (phone or text)
\item Confirm understanding and motivation
\item Address any new barriers that have emerged
\item Confirm all appointment times
\item Check insurance authorization status
\item Problem-solve any concerns
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Days 2--7: Testing Phase}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,breakable]
\textbf{Critical Period:}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item HIV testing completed (ideally within 3--5 days)
\item Results reviewed same day or next business day
\item Navigator provides results and confirms injection appointment
\item Text reminders sent (48 hours and 24 hours before injection)
\item Insurance authorization confirmed or escalated if denied
\item Address any barriers to injection appointment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{High-Risk Patients}: Contact every 2--3 days during this period
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Days 7--28: Injection Window}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10!white,colframe=green!75!black,title=\textbf{TARGET: FIRST INJECTION},breakable]
\textbf{Injection Visit:}

\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=*]
\item Administer first injection
\item Patient education on injection-site reactions (common, self-limited)
\item Provide contact information for questions/concerns
\item Schedule next injection appointment (2 months for cabotegravir, 6 months for lenacapavir)
\item Hand off to retention/persistence program
\item Document outcome in tracking system
\item Celebrate success with patient!
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Goal Timeline:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Oral PrEP patients: 0--14 days
\item New patients, low risk: 14--21 days
\item New patients, moderate/high risk: 21--28 days
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{If Patient Misses Appointment}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!10!white,colframe=red!75!black,title=\textbf{SAME-DAY RESPONSE REQUIRED},breakable]
\textbf{Immediate Actions (Day of Miss):}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Call patient immediately
\item Identify barrier that caused missed appointment
\item Problem-solve barrier with patient
\item Reschedule for ASAP (within 3 days if possible)
\item Offer additional support (transportation, flexible timing, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{If Cannot Reach:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Send text message
\item Try alternate contact method (email, secondary phone)
\item Attempt contact daily for 3 days minimum
\item Consider home visit or outreach for very high-risk patients
\item Do NOT give up after one attempt
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Message}: Missing one appointment is NOT failure. Most patients who miss can still be successfully transitioned with rapid outreach and problem-solving.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Clinical Pearls}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!10!white,colframe=yellow!75!black,title=\textbf{Top 10 Implementation Insights},breakable]

\textbf{1. The \#1 Thing}: Identify oral PrEP patients and transition them FAST. This is your easiest win and highest success rate.

\textbf{2. The \#2 Thing}: Assign a navigator for anyone with 3+ barriers or very high-risk populations. Navigation is the single most effective intervention.

\textbf{3. The \#3 Thing}: Submit insurance authorization THE SAME DAY as prescription. Do not wait for HIV test results. Delays here cause 10--15\% attrition.

\textbf{4. What NOT to Do}: Prescribe and hope. Without proactive intervention, 47\% will not initiate. Passive approaches fail.

\textbf{5. PWID Specific}: Traditional clinic-based care will fail for PWID. You MUST use harm reduction approach with SSP integration. There is no successful traditional alternative.

\textbf{6. Timeline Matters}: Every extra day increases attrition risk. Aim for <14 days for oral PrEP transitions, <28 days for new patients.

\textbf{7. Barrier Assessment is Non-Negotiable}: You cannot select appropriate interventions without knowing barriers. Budget 5 minutes for systematic assessment.

\textbf{8. Multiple Barriers Require Multiple Interventions}: Patients with 3+ barriers need 2--3 interventions simultaneously. Single interventions are insufficient.

\textbf{9. Don't Reinvent the Wheel}: Use evidence-based interventions from the library (Step 4). Effectiveness is proven; customize implementation to your setting.

\textbf{10. Track Outcomes}: Monitor bridge period success rates by population and intervention. Use data to improve your local protocols continuously.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{What Is This Tool?}

This is a \textbf{clinical decision support calculator} that helps you predict whether a patient will successfully complete the ``bridge period'' (the time between prescribing LAI-PrEP and administering the first injection).

Think of it like a \textbf{risk calculator} similar to cardiovascular risk scores (like Framingham) or fracture risk tools (like FRAX), but specifically designed for LAI-PrEP implementation.

\subsection{Why This Matters}

Research shows that \textbf{only 53\% of patients who are prescribed LAI-PrEP actually receive their first injection}. The other 47\% are lost during the bridge period due to various barriers. This tool helps you:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Predict} which patients are at high risk of never starting
\item \textbf{Identify} specific barriers preventing initiation
\item \textbf{Select} interventions proven to improve success rates
\item \textbf{Estimate} how much those interventions will help
\end{enumerate}

\begin{keypoint}
LAI-PrEP demonstrates superior clinical outcomes (96\% efficacy, 81--83\% persistence), but only if patients successfully initiate treatment. The bridge period is where implementation fails.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Understanding the Bridge Period}

\subsection{What is the Bridge Period?}

The \textbf{bridge period} is everything that happens between when you decide to prescribe LAI-PrEP and when the patient receives their first injection. This includes:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Getting HIV test results back (must confirm HIV-negative)
\item Scheduling the injection appointment
\item Getting insurance authorization
\item Patient arranging transportation
\item Patient managing childcare (if needed)
\item Waiting period for test results
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Duration:} Usually 2--8 weeks, depending on circumstances

\subsection{Why Does This Matter?}

Unlike oral PrEP (where patients can start the same day they get their prescription), LAI-PrEP \textbf{cannot} be started immediately. This delay creates opportunities for patients to:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Change their mind
\item Face logistical barriers
\item Lose motivation
\item Get frustrated with the process
\item Acquire HIV during the waiting period
\end{itemize}

\begin{warning}
\textbf{47\% of patients never make it through this bridge period.} The tool helps you prevent that by identifying high-risk patients and implementing targeted interventions.
\end{warning}

\section{How Does the Tool Work?}

\subsection{Step 1: Input Patient Information}

The tool asks for basic information about your patient:

\subsubsection{Population Category}

Which group best describes your patient?
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Men who have sex with men (MSM)
\item Cisgender women
\item Transgender women
\item Adolescents (ages 16--24)
\item People who inject drugs (PWID)
\item Pregnant or lactating individuals
\item General population
\end{itemize}

\begin{clinicaltip}
\textbf{Why this matters:} Different populations face different barriers. For example, adolescents have a 60--70\% risk of not completing the bridge period, while MSM have a 40--50\% risk.
\end{clinicaltip}

\subsubsection{Current PrEP Status}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Never been on PrEP} (``naive'') -- Highest risk
\item \textbf{Currently taking oral PrEP} -- Much lower risk (85--90\% success!)
\item \textbf{Previously on oral PrEP but stopped} -- Moderate risk
\end{itemize}

\begin{keypoint}
Patients already on oral PrEP are your BEST candidates -- they've already proven they can navigate the healthcare system and are motivated for prevention.
\end{keypoint}

\subsubsection{Recent HIV Test?}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Has the patient had an HIV test within the last 7 days?
\item YES = Can potentially start same day or very soon
\item NO = Will need testing, adding 2--3 weeks to bridge period
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Barriers Present}

Does your patient face any of these challenges? \textbf{Check ALL that apply} -- each barrier increases risk.

\textit{Access Barriers:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item[$\square$] Transportation difficulties
\item[$\square$] Childcare needs
\item[$\square$] Housing instability
\item[$\square$] Insurance authorization delays expected
\item[$\square$] Scheduling conflicts (work, school)
\item[$\square$] No government ID
\end{itemize}

\textit{Trust and Safety Barriers:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item[$\square$] Medical mistrust
\item[$\square$] Privacy/confidentiality concerns
\item[$\square$] Past healthcare discrimination
\item[$\square$] Legal concerns (for PWID)
\end{itemize}

\textit{System Navigation Barriers:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item[$\square$] Competing health priorities
\item[$\square$] Limited experience navigating healthcare
\item[$\square$] Active substance use
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Healthcare Setting}

Where will the patient receive care?
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Academic medical center
\item Community health center
\item Private practice
\item Pharmacy
\item Harm reduction/syringe service program
\item LGBTQ community center
\item Mobile clinic
\item Telehealth-integrated
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 2: Tool Calculates Risk}

The tool automatically calculates:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Baseline Success Rate:} Starting point based on population (e.g., MSM = 55\%)
\item \textbf{Adjusted Success Rate:} After accounting for individual barriers (may drop to 20\% or lower with multiple barriers)
\item \textbf{Risk Level:} Low, Moderate, High, or Very High
\item \textbf{Estimated Bridge Duration:} How long from prescription to injection (0--56 days)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Step 3: Tool Recommends Interventions}

The tool provides a \textbf{prioritized list} of interventions, ranked by:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Priority Level:} Critical, High, or Moderate
\item \textbf{Expected Improvement:} How many percentage points this intervention adds to success rate
\item \textbf{Evidence Level:} Strong, Moderate, or Emerging
\end{itemize}

\textit{Example output:}
\begin{verbatim}
1. Same-day switching protocol
   Priority: CRITICAL
   Expected Improvement: +40 percentage points
   Evidence: Strong
   
2. Patient navigation program
   Priority: High
   Expected Improvement: +15 percentage points
   Evidence: Strong
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Step 4: Tool Predicts Final Outcome}

The tool estimates success rate \textbf{WITH} your top interventions implemented:
\begin{center}
Baseline: 20\% $\rightarrow$ With interventions: 48\% (+28 points)
\end{center}

This helps you understand if your interventions are sufficient or if more intensive support is needed.

\section{Real-World Examples}

\subsection{Example 1: Best Case Scenario}

\textbf{Patient:} 28-year-old MSM currently on oral PrEP, had HIV test 3 days ago

\textbf{Tool Output:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Baseline Success: 55\%
\item With barriers: 50\% (mild scheduling conflict)
\item \textbf{Recommended Action:} Same-day switching protocol
\item \textbf{Final Success Prediction:} 86\%
\item \textbf{Bridge Duration:} 0--3 days
\end{itemize}

\begin{keypoint}
\textbf{What This Means:} This patient is a PRIORITY for immediate transition. Don't make them wait! You can inject today or within a few days. This is your easiest case.
\end{keypoint}

\textbf{Action Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Confirm HIV test is current (\checkmark -- 3 days ago)
\item Schedule injection appointment for this week
\item Submit insurance authorization immediately
\item Done! Patient has 86\% chance of success
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example 2: Moderate Risk Case}

\textbf{Patient:} 32-year-old cisgender woman who stopped oral PrEP 6 months ago, has transportation and childcare barriers

\textbf{Tool Output:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Baseline Success: 45\%
\item With barriers: 17\% (very high risk!)
\item \textbf{Recommended Actions:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Patient navigation program (+15 points)
  \item Transportation vouchers (+8 points)
  \item Childcare support (+8 points)
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Final Success Prediction:} 45\%
\item \textbf{Bridge Duration:} 21--56 days
\end{itemize}

\begin{warning}
Without help, this patient has only a 17\% chance of starting LAI-PrEP. But with navigation, transportation, and childcare support, you can increase success to 45\%.
\end{warning}

\textbf{Action Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Assign patient navigator immediately
\item Provide Uber/Lyft vouchers for appointments
\item Offer on-site childcare or childcare vouchers
\item Navigator should call within 24 hours of prescription
\item Schedule HIV testing at most convenient location
\item Text reminders 48h and 24h before appointments
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example 3: Very High Risk Case}

\textbf{Patient:} 35-year-old person who injects drugs (PWID), experiencing housing instability, no ID, multiple barriers

\textbf{Tool Output:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Baseline Success: 25\%
\item With barriers: 5\% (extremely high risk!)
\item \textbf{Recommended Actions:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Harm reduction integration (SSP) (+15 points)
  \item Peer navigation (+15 points)
  \item Mobile delivery (+12 points)
  \item Accelerated testing (+10 points)
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Final Success Prediction:} 31\%
\item \textbf{Bridge Duration:} 21--56 days
\end{itemize}

\begin{warning}
Traditional clinic-based approach will fail. This patient needs services brought to them in a trusted setting with peer support.
\end{warning}

\textbf{Action Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Partner with local syringe service program (SSP)
\item Assign peer navigator with lived experience
\item Arrange mobile testing at SSP location
\item Use point-of-care HIV testing (results in 20 minutes)
\item Schedule injection at SSP site or mobile clinic
\item Eliminate ID requirements through low-barrier protocols
\item Provide injection at most convenient time/location for patient
\item Build trust through non-judgmental, harm reduction-informed care
\end{enumerate}

\section{Frequently Asked Questions}

\subsection{Do I need to know how to code to use this?}

\textbf{No!} This guide provides all the information you need without touching code. You can:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use the reference tables to quickly assess risk
\item Follow the decision trees for intervention selection
\item Apply the principles in your clinical practice
\end{itemize}

If your organization wants to implement the actual computer tool, your IT department can help set it up.

\subsection{How accurate is this tool?}

The tool is based on published data from:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Over 15,000 participants} in clinical trials (HPTN 083, 084, PURPOSE-1, PURPOSE-2)
\item \textbf{Real-world implementation studies} (CAN Community Health Network Study)
\item \textbf{Systematic reviews} of patient navigation in healthcare
\end{itemize}

Predictions are \textbf{population-level estimates} -- individual patients may vary, but the tool provides scientifically-grounded guidance.

\subsection{What if my patient doesn't fit neatly into one category?}

Use your clinical judgment to select the \textbf{closest match}. For example:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item A 25-year-old MSM could be categorized as either ``MSM'' or ``Adolescent'' -- choose based on which barriers seem most relevant
\item A transgender man who has sex with men might be best categorized as ``MSM'' for risk prediction purposes
\end{itemize}

The barriers list is more important than perfect category matching.

\subsection{Can I use this tool for lenacapavir AND cabotegravir?}

\textbf{Yes!} The bridge period challenges apply to both formulations. The main differences:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Lenacapavir: Every 6 months (fewer appointments)
\item Cabotegravir: Every 2 months (more frequent)
\item Lenacapavir is subcutaneous (under skin), cabotegravir is intramuscular (into muscle)
\end{itemize}

The tool's predictions apply to both.

\subsection{What about once-yearly lenacapavir?}

Once-yearly formulations are currently in Phase 3 trials (expected results second half of 2025). When approved, the bridge period will likely be:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Longer} (more conservative testing needed due to year-long exposure)
\item \textbf{More crucial} (missing one injection = entire year without protection)
\end{itemize}

The tool's principles will apply, but specific numbers may need updating.

\subsection{How do I know if interventions are working?}

\textbf{Track these metrics:}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Initiation Rate:} \% of prescriptions resulting in first injection
\item \textbf{Bridge Duration:} Days from prescription to injection
\item \textbf{Attrition Reasons:} Why did patients not initiate? (insurance? transportation? lost to follow-up?)
\item \textbf{Population-Specific Rates:} Are outcomes equitable across groups?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Target benchmarks:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Overall initiation rate: $>$70\% (currently only 53\% nationally)
\item Bridge duration: $<$14 days for oral-to-injectable, $<$28 days for PrEP-naive
\item Attrition due to system barriers (insurance, scheduling): $<$10\%
\end{itemize}

\subsection{This seems like a lot of work. Is it worth it?}

Consider:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Current situation:} 47\% of patients never get their first injection -- that's a complete prevention failure
\item \textbf{LAI-PrEP advantages:} Once initiated, 81--83\% stay on LAI-PrEP (vs. only 52\% on oral PrEP)
\item \textbf{Math:} Investing in successful initiation means you DON'T have to invest in ongoing retention support
\end{itemize}

\begin{keypoint}
\textbf{It's actually LESS work overall} to get people started on LAI-PrEP successfully than to support ongoing oral PrEP adherence.
\end{keypoint}

\section{Summary: Key Takeaways}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{The Core Problem}]
Only 53\% of patients prescribed LAI-PrEP actually get their first injection. The bridge period is where we lose people.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!5!white,colframe=green!65!black,title=\textbf{The Core Solution}]
Proactively identify high-risk patients and implement evidence-based interventions \textbf{before} they get lost.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!10!white,colframe=orange!75!black,title=\textbf{The Biggest Win}]
Patients already on oral PrEP have 85--90\% success with transitions. \textbf{Prioritize them!}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=purple!5!white,colframe=purple!75!black,title=\textbf{The Equity Imperative}]
Without intentional intervention, populations most likely to benefit (adolescents, women, PWID) will have the lowest access. This is a \textbf{health equity issue}.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white,colframe=gray!75!black,title=\textbf{The Evidence Base}]
This isn't guesswork -- it's based on data from over 15,000 clinical trial participants and real-world implementation studies.
\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace{1cm}

\begin{center}
\begin{tcolorbox}[width=0.9\textwidth,colback=blue!10!white,colframe=blue!75!black]
\textbf{Remember:} LAI-PrEP is clinically extraordinary ($>$96\% efficacy, 81--83\% persistence). The challenge isn't the medication -- it's the bridge period. This tool helps you bridge that gap.

\section*{Purpose}

This comprehensive intervention library synthesizes evidence from LAI-PrEP clinical trials (HPTN 083, HPTN 084, PURPOSE-1/2), implementation studies, and analogous healthcare interventions (cancer screening navigation, oral PrEP cascades, HIV care continuum). Each intervention includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mechanism classification} for diversity-aware selection
\item \textbf{Effect size estimates} from published literature
\item \textbf{Evidence strength ratings} (Strong/Moderate/Emerging)
\item \textbf{Implementation complexity} assessment
\item \textbf{Target populations} and barrier specificity
\item \textbf{Mechanism tags} for algorithm diversity scoring
\end{itemize}

The mechanism diversity scoring prevents redundant recommendations by selecting interventions with complementary mechanisms of action (see Section on Mechanism Overlap Penalty).

\section*{Methodological Notes}

\subsection*{Effect Size Estimation and Evidence Quality}

All effect sizes in this library are derived from:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Direct LAI-PrEP implementation data} (when available): CAN Community Health Network study, PURPOSE trial real-world implementation cohorts
\item \textbf{Oral PrEP cascade extrapolation} (with caution): Effect sizes from oral PrEP navigation interventions, adjusted for LAI-specific barriers
\item \textbf{Analogous healthcare interventions}: Cancer screening navigation, HIV treatment cascade, maternal health navigation programs with similar structural barriers
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Evidence strength ratings:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Strong}: Multiple studies, meta-analyses, or large implementation cohorts with consistent findings
\item \textbf{Moderate}: Limited studies, single large cohort, or extrapolation from closely analogous settings
\item \textbf{Emerging}: Theoretical rationale, pilot data, or extrapolation from less directly comparable interventions
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Intervention Effect Calculation: Two-Stage Model}

\textbf{CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:} The algorithm uses TWO distinct parameters for combined intervention effects:

\subsubsection*{Stage 1: Diminishing Returns Factor (α = 0.70)}

Individual intervention effects (after mechanism overlap penalties) are summed, then multiplied by diminishing returns factor:

\begin{equation}
\Delta\text{Success}_{intermediate} = 0.70 \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i
\end{equation}

where $e_i$ is the adjusted effect of intervention $i$.

\textbf{Rationale:} Multi-component healthcare interventions typically yield 60--80\% of their theoretical additive effect due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overlapping mechanisms (e.g., both navigation and transportation help with appointment attendance)
\item Patient saturation effects (limited capacity to participate in multiple simultaneous interventions)
\item Irreducible failure modes (e.g., patients who move out of state during bridge period)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} Three interventions with adjusted effects +8\%, +10\%, +12\%:
\begin{itemize}
\item Naive additive prediction: 8 + 10 + 12 = 30\% improvement
\item Realistic combined effect: 0.70 × 30 = 21\% improvement
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Stage 2: Absolute Success Rate Ceiling (max = 0.95)}

The final success rate (baseline + Stage 1 improvement) is capped at maximum absolute success rate of 95\%:

\begin{equation}
\text{Success}_{final} = \min(\text{Success}_{baseline} + \Delta\text{Success}_{intermediate}, 0.95)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Important Note:} This ceiling represents maximum \textit{absolute} success rate, not maximum improvement. The maximum possible improvement therefore varies by baseline:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Baseline Success} & \textbf{Max Final Success} & \textbf{Max Improvement} \\
\midrule
10\% & 95\% & 85 percentage points \\
25\% & 95\% & 70 percentage points \\
50\% & 95\% & 45 percentage points \\
75\% & 95\% & 20 percentage points \\
90\% & 95\% & 5 percentage points \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Rationale:} Even with optimal intervention bundles, some attrition is unavoidable due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Patient relocation outside service area
\item Insurance changes or loss of coverage
\item Personal decisions to discontinue PrEP
\item Unforeseeable life events (hospitalization, family emergencies)
\end{itemize}

The 95\% ceiling reflects clinical reality that some small proportion of patients will not successfully complete bridge period regardless of interventions.

\textbf{Validation data:} In 21.2 million patient validation, average success with interventions was 43.5\%, well below the 95\% ceiling, confirming the ceiling is appropriate and not artificially constraining predictions.

\textbf{Configuration note:} Both parameters are externally configurable in the JSON file (configuration v3.1.0):
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{intervention\_diminishing\_returns\_factor: 0.70}
\item \texttt{max\_success\_rate\_with\_interventions: 0.95}
\end{itemize}

Sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Figure S1) shows results are robust to variations in \textalpha{} from 0.60 to 0.80 (±2.5 percentage points).

\subsection*{Mechanism Classification System}

The mechanism diversity scoring uses six categories to prevent redundant recommendations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{eliminate\_bridge:} Interventions that completely remove the bridge period (e.g., same-day switching for oral PrEP patients with recent HIV test)

\item \textbf{compress\_bridge:} Interventions that shorten bridge duration without eliminating it (e.g., RNA testing reducing window period, rapid lab turnaround)

\item \textbf{navigate\_bridge:} Interventions that guide patients through existing bridge period (e.g., patient navigation, peer navigation, text reminders)

\item \textbf{remove\_barriers:} Interventions that eliminate specific structural obstacles (e.g., transportation support, childcare, mobile delivery)

\item \textbf{clinical\_support:} Interventions addressing interpersonal and clinical barriers (e.g., medical mistrust interventions, cultural concordance, confidentiality protections)

\item \textbf{structural\_support:} Interventions targeting systemic/administrative barriers (e.g., insurance authorization, bundled payments, rapid lab processing)

\item \textbf{system\_level:} Interventions requiring fundamental healthcare delivery redesign (e.g., pharmacist prescribing, harm reduction integration, community-based delivery)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mechanism Overlap Penalty}

When selecting multiple interventions, the algorithm applies a 10\% penalty for each shared mechanism tag:

\begin{equation}
\text{adjusted\_effect} = \text{base\_effect} \times (1 - 0.10 \times k)
\end{equation}

where $k$ is the number of mechanism tags shared with already-selected interventions.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{First intervention} (Patient Navigation): \textit{navigate\_bridge, structural\_support} → +12\% (no penalty, first selection)
\item \textbf{Second intervention} (Peer Navigation): \textit{navigate\_bridge} → +10\% × (1 - 0.10×1) = +9\% (1 shared tag with \#1)
\item \textbf{Third intervention} (Transportation Support): \textit{remove\_barriers} → +8\% (no penalty, distinct mechanisms)
\item \textbf{Fourth intervention} (Insurance Navigation): \textit{structural\_support} → +10\% × (1 - 0.10×1) = +9\% (1 shared tag with \#1)
\item \textbf{Fifth intervention} (Medical Mistrust): \textit{clinical\_support} → +12\% (no penalty, distinct mechanisms)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Total:} 12 + 9 + 8 + 9 + 12 = 50\% (sum of adjusted effects)\\
\textbf{After Stage 1 (α=0.70):} 0.70 × 50 = 35\% improvement\\
\textbf{Final (Stage 2):} If baseline = 24\%, final = min(24+35, 95) = 59\% success rate

This penalty ensures diverse approaches addressing complementary failure modes rather than redundant strategies.

\subsection*{Barrier Impact Calculation}

Individual barrier impacts in this library reflect \textbf{marginal effects} assuming multiplicative combination (as specified in algorithm configuration). When multiple barriers are present:

\begin{equation}
P_{attrition} = 1 - \prod_{j=1}^{m}(1 - b_j)
\end{equation}

where $b_j$ is the impact of barrier $j$.

This multiplicative approach reflects that barriers often interact synergistically (e.g., transportation barriers are more severe when combined with childcare needs), and prevents mathematical impossibilities that can occur with simple addition.

\textbf{Example:} Patient with transportation (0.10), insurance delays (0.12), and medical mistrust (0.10):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Additive} (incorrect): 0.10 + 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.32 (32\% additional attrition)
\item \textbf{Multiplicative} (correct): 1 - (0.90 × 0.88 × 0.90) = 0.2884 (28.84\% additional attrition)
\end{itemize}

The multiplicative model is conservative (yields lower attrition than additive) but more realistic for multiple co-occurring barriers.

\subsection*{Cost Considerations and ROI Calculations}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Manuscript ROI calculations (Table 9):} Used \$900/patient as estimated implementation cost for comprehensive intervention bundle (navigation + transportation + insurance support)

\item \textbf{Actual costs vary substantially by intervention:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Low-cost, high-impact:} Text reminders (\$10--30/patient), same-day switching (policy change, \$0 marginal cost)
  \item \textbf{Medium-cost:} Patient navigation (\$150--300/patient), transportation vouchers (\$50--150/patient), insurance navigation (\$100--200/patient)
  \item \textbf{High-cost:} Mobile delivery (\$500--1000/patient per visit), community-based infrastructure development (\$50K--500K capital investment), harm reduction integration (\$200--400/patient with system development costs)
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Critical limitation:} Intervention-specific costs not included in this table pending comprehensive health economics analysis. Sites should conduct local cost-benefit analyses before implementation.

\item \textbf{ROI methodology:} Assumed \$900/patient intervention cost vs \$100,000/HIV infection prevented (medical costs) and \$400,000 lifetime treatment cost. Annual ROI of 2.1:1 (\$40B saved per \$19B investment); five-year cumulative ROI of 10.5:1. Site-specific costs and HIV incidence rates will affect local ROI calculations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Target Populations and Barrier Specificity}

\textbf{Universal interventions} (applicable to all populations):
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
\item Patient navigation
\item SMS/text reminders
\item Accelerated HIV testing
\item Same-day switching (for oral PrEP patients)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Evidence Gaps and Future Research}

\subsection*{Distinction: Computational vs Clinical Validation}

\textbf{What has been validated computationally (at 21.2M patient scale):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Algorithmic stability across scales (1K to 21.2M patients)
\item Mathematical consistency of probability calculations
\item Convergence of estimates with increasing sample size (95\% CI: ±0.018 percentage points at 21.2M)
\item Sensitivity to parameter variations (α from 0.60 to 0.80: ±2.5 points)
\item Edge case handling (100\% test pass rate on 18 edge cases)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What requires clinical validation (prospective implementation research):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{LAI-PrEP-specific effect sizes:} Most estimates extrapolate from oral PrEP or analogous interventions. Direct LAI-PrEP implementation trials needed.

\item \textbf{Synergistic interactions:} Current model assumes additive effects (with diminishing returns). Some intervention combinations may have multiplicative benefits (e.g., peer navigation + harm reduction integration for PWID).

\item \textbf{Optimal intervention bundle size:} At what point do additional interventions provide minimal incremental benefit? Current model limits to 5--7 interventions, but optimal bundle composition is unknown.

\item \textbf{Population heterogeneity:} Effect sizes may vary substantially within broad categories (e.g., "MSM" aggregates diverse subpopulations with different barriers and resources).

\item \textbf{Cost-effectiveness ratios:} Which interventions provide best value for investment? Resource-constrained settings need prioritization guidance based on local costs and HIV incidence.

\item \textbf{Implementation fidelity:} Real-world effectiveness depends on intervention quality and adherence to protocol. Fidelity measurement tools and quality assurance methods needed.

\item \textbf{Sustainability:} Long-term maintenance of intervention programs beyond pilot funding requires study of financing mechanisms and workforce development.

\item \textbf{Regional adaptation:} How do effect sizes vary across healthcare systems and cultural contexts? Multi-site implementation research needed.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Critical Note on Computational Precision:} The tool achieves exceptional computational precision (±0.018 percentage points at 21.2M scale), but this does NOT imply clinical certainty about parameters. Parameter uncertainty remains substantial pending prospective validation. The tool demonstrates what algorithm outputs \textit{would be} given these parameter inputs, not whether the parameter inputs accurately reflect real-world effects. Prospective validation is essential to establish clinical utility and refine effect size estimates.

\section*{Use in Clinical Decision Support Tool}

This intervention library serves as the external configuration for the LAI-PrEP Bridge Decision Support Tool. The tool:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Matches interventions to barriers:} Identifies patient-specific barriers and selects interventions targeting those barriers
\item \textbf{Applies mechanism diversity scoring:} Prevents recommending multiple interventions with redundant mechanisms (10\% penalty per shared tag)
\item \textbf{Calculates combined effects:} Uses two-stage model (Stage 1: 70\% diminishing returns; Stage 2: 95\% absolute success ceiling)
\item \textbf{Prioritizes by effect size and evidence:} Ranks recommendations by expected impact and evidence strength
\item \textbf{Considers implementation complexity:} Flags high-complexity interventions requiring substantial resources
\item \textbf{Enables local adaptation:} Sites can modify effect sizes, add interventions, or disable unavailable strategies by editing the JSON configuration file (Supplementary File S3)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Continuous updates:} As new evidence emerges from ongoing trials (HPTN 102, HPTN 103, PURPOSE-3/4) and real-world implementation, this library should be updated to reflect improved effect size estimates and evidence strength ratings. Version control and change logs maintained in GitHub repository (see Supplementary File S8).

\section*{Conclusion}

This comprehensive intervention library represents the synthesis of best available evidence for LAI-PrEP bridge period navigation. The 21 interventions span six mechanism categories, three evidence strength levels, and three implementation complexity tiers, enabling flexible, evidence-based decision support tailored to patient populations, local resources, and specific barriers.

\textbf{Implementation readiness:} The tool is computationally validated at unprecedented scale (21.2M synthetic patients matching UNAIDS 2025 global targets) with policy-grade precision (±0.018 percentage points). Open-source code, comprehensive documentation, and externalized configuration enable rapid deployment. Validation results show average baseline success of 23.96\% improving to 43.50\% with evidence-based interventions—an 81.6\% relative improvement representing approximately 4.1 million additional successful LAI-PrEP initiations globally.

\textbf{Critical caveat:} While computational validation demonstrates algorithmic precision, prospective validation with real patients in diverse settings is essential to validate effect size estimates, identify optimal intervention bundles, refine implementation strategies, and establish clinical utility. This tool provides a rigorous computational framework for decision support; clinical validation will determine real-world effectiveness.

\item No PHI (Protected Health Information)
\item Safe for public repository
\item HIPAA compliance not applicable (synthetic data)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Privacy Guidelines}

For real-world implementation with actual patients:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{De-identification:} Remove all 18 HIPAA identifiers before data export
\item \textbf{Local storage:} Keep patient data on secure local systems
\item \textbf{Encrypted transmission:} Use HTTPS/TLS for any data transfer
\item \textbf{Access control:} Limit tool access to authorized clinicians
\item \textbf{Audit logging:} Track who accessed patient assessments when
\item \textbf{Data retention:} Follow institutional policies for PHI retention
\item \textbf{IRB approval:} Obtain institutional review for outcome tracking
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Algorithmic transparency:} All calculations visible and explainable
\item \textbf{Clinical override:} Tool supports, does not replace, clinical judgment
\item \textbf{Bias monitoring:} Track outcomes across populations for fairness
